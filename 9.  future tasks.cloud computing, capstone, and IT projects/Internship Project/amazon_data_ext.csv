I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.",It's okay.,2023-08-17,3.0

Unlike many people I can't justify spending more than $200 on a phone that is likely to be dropped/broken/malfunctioning within a couple years. Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they'd just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their 'tap to wake' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.","Overall good phone, fast hardware.

I tended to rest it on my chest while talking on speaker phone and the speaker was muffled by my shirt.  It also had pointy edges along the part where the speaker opening is at the bottom. It was uncomfortable and bulky to hold while trying to talk or watch videos. The part that was most annoying is that it kept disconnecting from the wifi and without knowing that it had, I ended up using up all of my 5g of data for the month in one day.  Every time I would reconnect to wifi, it would drop again. After a week I just had enough and returned the phone.  With the case I bought it was also too heavy for the magnetic phone holder and would just slide off.  The fingerprint reader was also not easy to access, especially with the case on. Overall, just poorly designed and non ergonomic. One of my worst experiences with a new phone.",Not the best design and wifi kept dropping,2023-08-23,3.0
B0B3PSRHHN,Google Pixel 6a - 5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with 12 Megapixel Camera and 24-Hour Battery - Charcoal,339.99,4.3,5200,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B3PSRHHN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,4.0,"The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",189.0,R3AAKHR07NTT1B,5.0,More than meets my needs,24.0,R4KHL0ERH66X7,4.0,Solid phone so far and I'm very pleased with it,1.0,R3840XP5ER7LXA,4.0,"For the price, there isn't a better option!",0.0,R1EJ4Q5CVD6V2Z,4.0,"Moving on from Moto G line, great alternative",47.0,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,Thomas Hicks,189.0,"TLDR:  The Pixel 6a is a phone that I can safely recommend to anyone who just wants a device that works, takes decent enough pictures, can get through the day on a single charge, and won't break the bank or double one's monthly mobile bill for the next 2 years.  Tech enthusiasts need not apply.However, as a tech enthusiast who bought one of these as a second phone, I could see myself dailying the Pixel 6a without too many regrets.  I mean, I would feel guilty for coming down hard on it in any particular category simply because it's so darn affordable (particularly when it's on sale).  Plus, there's really nothing else in this price range I can recommend to others with any confidence.  What else can you get for around $300 that is this well-rounded?  In the US?  Not much, though you can get some cheapo Motorola phones for less if you're willing to settle for a weak processor, mediocre cameras, an LCD display (rather than OLED), and a cheaper-feeling, all-plastic build.  You'll also have to settle for weaker software support than the Pixel, which guarantees security updates for another 4 years from now (as well as two more Android OS updates after 13).The nearest competitor is probably the Samsung Galaxy A53 (soon to be A54).  It's also on sale regularly, though I've never seen it as low as the 6a has been.  The Sammy does give you a better display (120Hz AMOLED vs 60Hz OLED) and a bigger battery than the Pixel, but it has a weaker Exynos CPU and worse cameras despite the more impressive specs on paper.  I'd take the Pixel 6a hands down, and that's coming from an 11-year Samsung Galaxy fan.Anyway, onto my detailed personal critique of the Pixel 6a...As I said before, I can't really knock it much considering the price point.  HOWEVER, there are a few sore spots that annoy me and will hopefully be improved upon with the upcoming 7a.The first is the display.  While I appreciate the inclusion of an OLED panel at this price, the 60Hz refresh rate makes my eyes bleed while scrolling.  Harsh?  Yeah, but I've been spoiled by 120Hz displays for years now.  Jumping between this and my S22 Ultra regularly makes the difference even more noticeable.  The 7a is supposed to bump it up to 90Hz, which should greatly improve smoothness.  Refresh rate aside, I also find the display to be a bit on the dim side.  Not that it isn't bright enough in most cases (aside from direct sunlight), but even indoors with minimal lighting the display will adjust to about 50% brightness to maintain adequate visibility.  Meanwhile, my Samsung phones (S22 Ultra and old S21+) are only at 25% brightness in the same environment and still somehow appear to be brighter.  And the colors never seem to pop as much on this phone compared to other OLED-equipped phones I've used.  I suppose that's a key difference between OLED and AMOLED.The second issue is the durability of the materials used to make this phone, mainly the plastic on the back panel.  When brand new, the plastic back does an incredible job of imitating the appearance and feel of glass.  But after minimal use (and even inside of a case, as another reviewer pointed out), this material reveals itself to be ridiculously soft and prone to nicks and scratches.  Mine is covered in little pock marks and micro abrasions despite being in a case the majority of its life.  It's so soft that I swear the little nicks in it are probably from dust particles being pressed into it by popping a case on.  Another ding goes to the dated Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display that's also prone to scratches and sounds really thin and hollow when tapped.  I recommend a screen protector.While steady software updates since the phone's release last July have greatly improved the overall user experience, it still suffers from a few hardware-related headaches.  The modem used in this thing (and its siblings) is infamous for being inefficient, having mediocre reception (though I haven't noticed), and creating massive amounts of heat.  Sadly, no amount of updates can remedy that situation.  It's fine as long as you stick to LTE, in my experience.  Enabling 5G pretty much guarantees that your battery will drain much more quickly and that the back of the phone will stay warm at all times.  On the bright side, you can put it in your back pocket and use it as a ""butt warmer"" on cold days.  If you get a second 6a, you can heat both cheeks evenly.  Don't have heated seats in your car?  Problem solved.  Jokes aside, at least the fingerprint reader and random idle battery drain issues that I experienced early on have been fixed.  It's been months since I've gone to bed with 100% battery only to wake up with 65% left for no reason other than ""just Pixel things"" as a friend of mine with a 6 Pro would call little irritating bugs like those.Now that I've done nothing but blast this poor thing in the previous few paragraphs, let me tell you what I think is great about it.For one, I love the size.  While many out there still think it's too large, I think it's perfect.  After handling a behemoth like the S22 Ultra, this one is a pleasure to grasp even while in a case (of which I recommend the Spigen Rugged Armor, but that's another review).  It's just so light and easy to grip compared to what I'm used to.  It's no Zenfone 9 or iPhone 13 Mini, but it feels downright tiny compared to an S22/23 Ultra or Pixel 6/7 Pro.  Folks with small hands or who simply prefer smaller phones will like this one.  This is the compact option in the realm of budget and mid-range phones, as most inexpensive smartphones have 6.5""+ screens for some reason (I guess they're cheaper to make?).The Pixel software perks are probably my second favorite ""feature"" (though I'm not sure if size can be called a feature...well, maybe but nvm).  Being able to see the title and artist of just about any song playing around me at a glance is something I never knew I wanted.  And while I haven't used them personally, the call waiting assistance and Direct My Call (on-screen choices for automated calls) features sound amazing for simplifying a few of life's little annoyances.  I'm sure there's a lot of great things I'm forgetting to mention but those stand out the most for me.Finally, there's the cameras.  Nothing about the hardware here is fancy or premium, or even new.  In fact, the 6a's main image sensor (Sony IMX363) has been used in the Pixel line as far back as the Pixel 3.  What's propping up these tiny, dated image sensors is Google's amazing camera software and image processing.  While the images produced by this combo won't blow you away, you'll be impressed by just how competent and ""honest"" the results are.  The colors and details are very muted and realistic.  If you're fond of the super-colorful, oversharpened, Ultra HDR photos your typical Samsung phone cranks out, you'll be very disappointed by this phone (and Pixels in general) and should look elsewhere.  I actually prefer the main and ultra-wide cameras on this Pixel to my S22 Ultra for the simple fact that it's better at quick, point and shoot photography.  I can whip the 6a out of my pocket, snap a quick photo, and be 100% confident that resulting picture will be serviceable.  I can't say that about any Samsung that I've ever used.  The main con is the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.  You can zoom up to 7X with the main camera, but your pictures start looking like watercolor paintings at that level of zoom.  I'd go no higher than 3X and even that is pushing it.Other notes to close out this lengthy, rambling review:Speakers are just okay, and the volume slider has to be cranked fairly high to produce enough sound for normal listening.Battery life is fine, but should honestly be better with a 4410 mAh battery onboard.  In a regular day of use for me, I average about 4-5 hours of screen on time with 5G enabled.I can squeeze out an extra hour or two if I disable 5G and stick to LTE, and the phone runs much cooler on average as an added bonus.  I had a OnePlus 8T with a similarly-sized 4500 mAh battery and snapdragon 865 that could get up to 8 hours of SoT (with 5G disabled, as well), so I feel like the Tensor G1 isn't the most efficient SoC around.Charging is slow, coming from someone who used to daily a OnePlus with 65W Warp Charging.  Still, you can fully charge it in less than 2 hours from nearly-dead.  Could be worse, I guess.  Also, there's no wireless charging on the 6a.As far as performance goes, I can't complain about it in daily use scenarios.  It feels very responsive when opening and navigating my usual apps (Gmail, Twitter, twitch, YouTube, Amazon, etc.).  I'm not a phone gamer, so I can't comment on gaming performance though I imagine that it gets rather hot in a short period of time as that's just what the Tensor does.I've already stated repeatedly that I can recommend this phone to just about anyone because it does just about everything well enough for the average person.  However, the 7a is on the horizon and is expected to bring a 90Hz display, wireless charging, the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7, and better cameras for a similar RRP.  While it won't be as affordable as the discounted 6a when it launches this summer, I imagine we'll be seeing it in the $300 range by Black Friday.  So you may want to wait for that one unless you need a new phone right now.  Still, the 6a at its current price is an absolute bargain, in my honest opinion.","The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",2023-03-22,4.0,R2IRNTEPVHZ7G4,TS,69.0,"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),2022-08-04,3.0

If your child is using the phone a lot, they'll need to make sure to plug it in overnight.Third, the phone can be a bit laggy when scrolling through screens. This is likely due to the pre-installed apps and the slow charging speed.the TCL 30 Z is a decent option for kids who need a basic smartphone for entertainment.

I've now had it for over a month. As you read on you'll see my impressions after 2 weeks. I just want to add, I am thrilled with this phone after over a month and lots of use. Battery is great, not two days, but a whole day. Everything about it very good. Of course, I don't know about longevity, but if this phone continues for a year or so as it is now it will above 5 stars to me. I've had this about 2 weeks. I tried 2 other phones and returned them without any hassle. Thank you Amazon. But this phone was under $200 and I'm very happy with it. The 6 gb ram is very efficient and the 256 gb storage is more than enough plus I get to keep photos and docs on an SD card. I don't play games beyond solitaire and gin rummy so a super phone with high end specs for sophisticated games is obviously not a priority. I read a lot so I'll have a book, dictionary, Wikipedia, email, and text open at same time and there is no lag when switching between apps. Photos are fine for me. Not and expert photographer so was not looking for phone to double as top of line camera. But photos are excellent for my standards. Screen is bright and clear. It has good receiver for phone calls, I'm on Tello. Calls are clear and not one drop so far. I have another phone other than Motorola that drops calls. I contribute the drops to the receiver unit in the phone. I have two Motorola cells and both have good receiver capabilities. Wifi is both 5g and 2.4g and again, great speedy connection. I use ATT wifi. I also use the phone to keep track of my steps. That's important to me. It is very accurate if that's a priority to you. Also it connects to my Samsung Galaxy Watch with no problems. The 6.5 inch screen is a perfect size for me. My only wish is that it were a bit lighter, but not as heavy as the Moto G stylus I also have.

Inside no packing material and phone box not taped shut and inside everything very used and phone not in sleeve but in the blue inner box paperwork comes it. It had been ripped up completely and taped together in pieces. Miraculously the phone is not scratched up. I regret buying used again. I must be an idiot, but the internal speaker at least works. From a very nice exp with a defective phone to a very used and overpriced used phone. It's a 100.00 at best the way I received it. For another 30.00 a brand new phone.

READ THIS!,17.0,RH2T1GVHU3KQ4,5.0,Great phone,3.0,R10E07I4RWKZZN,Kevin Smith,10.0,"I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point!

Once part of the screen looked like I had cracked it and went black but when I restarted it went away. The fingerprint sensor is reliable when used with the protector that comes installed from the factory, but isn't as good with aftermarket ones.

Problem is it freezes up with OEM email app, OEM texting app, and an installed forum app. Locking up has progressively gotten worse over the last few weeks. For example attempting to do the return through Amazon app I ended up staring at an all white screen for about a minute before I gave up, rebooted and tried again.Also if I'm running Spotify in the background or get a phone call, no apps want to work afterwards. Have to reboot, crazy!With these specs I can't believe it. I must have gotten a lemon or something I don't know. Can't recommend though either way.

My review:Size: this phone is at least 30% larger than my old phone. Fortunately I do not carry it around often so it probably won't be a major issue. However, if you are looking for a portable phone that will fit in a regular pocket, be aware.Set up: tracfone support was useless. They wanted to send me a code to complete the set up, but my old phone was broken so they said they could not, nor did they offer any other options. Fortunately, my adult son switched the sim card from my old phone into the new one and i was able to receive the code on my new phone and complete the process. Without him I would still not have a functional phone.Charging cable: phone did not come with a functional charging cable and to use the one that was sent would have required another purchase. I ended up using the cable from my Fire tablet, which sufficed.Performance: as always there is a learning curve with new technology but so far i am feeling my way along with this phone. Don't expect to receive a user manual because one does not come with this phone. Downloaded one from the internet but it is poorly written and not user friendly. You Tube videos are available for some issues, however. So far the phone seems to be working ok.Lost data: i am still trying to figure out if I can retrieve my contacts, photos, etc from my old phone to transfer to new phone. I probably won't even bother to do this thru tracfone because I'm sure it would only frustrate me and make me want to kill myself. I will explore other avenues.Summary: inexpensive phone with some good attributes. B+ for the phone: D- for tracfone.",Large phone.

B0BCQXXRJJ,Google Pixel 7-5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with Wide Angle Lens and 24-Hour Battery - 128GB - Obsidian,495.0,4.3,3000,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0BCQXXRJJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,RE4ER1P5QMX1S,4.0,Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,13.0,R33OZ0QVN7YS8Q,4.0,Better Value than a Galaxy S23,96.0,R506S9F5UZDED,5.0,Great phone and cheap price!!!,0.0,R3VCN7DUWEMOFF,5.0,Good Value,0.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,3.0,"Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",108.0,RE4ER1P5QMX1S,Realm of Nova,13.0,"As a longtime user of Pixel phones, I can't help but keep coming back to them even when I try a different phone, except this time.While the Pixel 7 continues to be one of the best value options on the market, my Pixel arrived with a faint but noticeable screen defect in which there were three shadow-like gray areas in the top, middle, and bottom portions of the screen that were very noticeable on bright backgrounds. This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,2023-09-10,4.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,TJ,108.0,"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this","Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",2022-11-16,3.0

It has a large 6.52-inch IPS display, a 50MP main camera, a 5150mAh battery, and runs on Android 12. It also comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. The phone is powered by the Unisoc Tiger T610 octa-core processor, which delivers decent performance and efficiency.  All setup and app operations were performed smoothly and without and issues.  I experienced no crashes or other negative performance issues throughout my time using this device.ProsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a sleek and stylish design, with a right-angle frame and a glossy back. It comes in two colors: Galaxy Blue and Starry Black. I received the Galaxy Blue and found this finish to be really quality and not a fingerprint magnet.  Also Super Bonus, the device was delivered with a case which is awesome!The phone has a large and immersive display, with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a waterdrop notch. The screen has a resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels, which is adequate for watching videos and browsing the web.The phone has a powerful 50MP main camera, which can capture detailed and vivid photos in various scenarios. It also has a 2MP depth camera for portrait mode, and an 8MP selfie camera. The phone supports night mode, HDR, panorama, and 1080p video recording. I had no issues watching videos or editing photos all were done with speed and ease.The phone has a massive 5150mAh battery, which can last for more than a day of moderate use. It also supports fast charging with a 10W charger included in the box. - I never had an issue with the battery running out before a full day of use which I cannot say the same for other devices I have used lately.The phone runs on Android 12, which offers enhanced privacy features, dynamic personalization, and faster app startup. The phone also has minimal bloatware and offers a smooth user experience.The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and face unlock, which are fast and convenient to use. It also has other sensors such as accelerometer, proximity, and compass.The phone supports global bands, dual SIM, dual standby, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, and USB Type-C. It does not have NFC though.ConsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a low screen resolution compared to other phones in its price range. It also has thick bezels around the display, which reduce the screen-to-body ratio.The phone does not have a dedicated microSD slot, but uses a hybrid SIM slot instead. This means that users have to choose between dual SIM or extra storage.The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which may disappoint some users who prefer wired headphones. It also does not have stereo speakers or Dolby Atmos support.ConclusionThe Umidigi G1 Max is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers some impressive specs for its price. It has a large display, a powerful camera, a huge battery, and Android 12. It also has ample RAM and storage space, and supports global bands. All around a great device that checks in much higher performance wise than the low price tag would otherwise indicate!!",Fantastic Budget Option Android That Punches Above It's Weight Class With Features,2023-05-25,5.0,R3KDM6LHGWP8EC,Ron Novak,6.0,"See edits belowI bought the G 1 Max to replace another old phone. Had already bought an UMIDGI Bison 2 Pro, WHICH WORKS WITH VERIZON. I checked the specs on the G 1 Max, looked the same as the Bison. When I got it, I checked out the G 1 AND IT DOESN'T WORK (voice and text) WITH VERIZON..... Well, why? After an hour talking to a Verizon Tech Person, I think I know. The write-up says it doesn't work with CDMA providers like Verizon, but Verizon has discontinued CDMA. So that is meaningless. They use 4 G LTE now... This phone uses 4 G LTE, so it must work.... NOT! Verizon uses 4 G LTE with VOLTE, Voice Over LTE..... So to work with Verizon the device has to have VOLTE.. The Bison 2 Pro has it (just try to find it in the specs!), and it's good with Verizon, the G 1 Max doesn't and it doesn't work....... Connects, but no texts or voice.....This is too bad, since the G 1Max is a really nice phone. I would like to find one like it that works with Verizon. And it helps that it's half the price of the Bison 2 Pro. I'm on my second Bison, the screen on the first went black and white and started flashing on and off.... We'll see how the second holds up.Guess I'll have to do more research on the pathetic UMIDGI website to find all their 4 G, VOLTE devices....... Happy hunting!EDIT 1Looking at the glitzy UMIDIGI website dazzles the eye but doesn’t tell you much, like all sales pitches. HOWEVER, looking at the specs for a similar device to the G1 MAX, the C1 MAX, (they are lumped together) it look as if the C1 does support VOLTE. That said, the specs of the two devices are lumped together, but the G1 does not have VOLTE. So, I am going to order the C1 MAX and see if it actually works on Verizon. I commented to the techs at UMIDIGI that they ought to segregate the devices by generation and have a category for VOLTE since it seems to be the deciding factor in whether a device works with Verizon. Don’t hold your breath! Stay tuned for the next edit!Edit 2Neither the C1 nor the G1 is likely to work with Verizon. With a lot of research and an hour with a Verizon “technician”, I have come to the conclusion that in order for a cellphone to work with Verizon, two things are necessary; First, the phone has to use VOLTE, and Second, it has to use bands 2, 4, AND 13! (This is for 4G only) Neither the C1 nor the G1 has band 13, and they probably won’t work. I checked the specs of 11 Umidgi phones and bought an A11 to check this hypothesis out. It has both VOLTE and bands 2, 4, and 13. AND IT WORKS FINE WITH VERIZON!!!!! And it is priced at ~$109!!!!!! So check the specs and don’t get stuck……..Edit 3I have upgraded my rating to 3 stars since I think that the G1 Max is a fine phone, it just doesn't work with Verizon....... The experience I had with it otherwise (GPS, cruising the internet, etc) was a good one. Like I indicated, I wish the phone worked with Verizon! The build quality is good and it is a bargain!","DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON, PERIOD!!!!!! See edit",2023-03-02,3.0

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.",It's okay.,2023-08-17,3.0

Unlike many people I can't justify spending more than $200 on a phone that is likely to be dropped/broken/malfunctioning within a couple years. Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they'd just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their 'tap to wake' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.","Overall good phone, fast hardware. Mediocre moto software",2023-08-31,4.0,R2LFWQSME0K77O,Heimish Reviews,0.0,"There are a couple design flaws.  First, the speaker is at the bottom of the phone. I tended to rest it on my chest while talking on speaker phone and the speaker was muffled by my shirt.  It also had pointy edges along the part where the speaker opening is at the bottom. It was uncomfortable and bulky to hold while trying to talk or watch videos. The part that was most annoying is that it kept disconnecting from the wifi and without knowing that it had, I ended up using up all of my 5g of data for the month in one day.  Every time I would reconnect to wifi, it would drop again. After a week I just had enough and returned the phone.  With the case I bought it was also too heavy for the magnetic phone holder and would just slide off.  The fingerprint reader was also not easy to access, especially with the case on. Overall, just poorly designed and non ergonomic. One of my worst experiences with a new phone.",Not the best design and wifi kept dropping,2023-08-23,3.0
B0B3PSRHHN,Google Pixel 6a - 5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with 12 Megapixel Camera and 24-Hour Battery - Charcoal,339.99,4.3,5200,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B3PSRHHN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,4.0,"The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",189.0,R3AAKHR07NTT1B,5.0,More than meets my needs,24.0,R4KHL0ERH66X7,4.0,Solid phone so far and I'm very pleased with it,1.0,R3840XP5ER7LXA,4.0,"For the price, there isn't a better option!",0.0,R1EJ4Q5CVD6V2Z,4.0,"Moving on from Moto G line, great alternative",47.0,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,Thomas Hicks,189.0,"TLDR:  The Pixel 6a is a phone that I can safely recommend to anyone who just wants a device that works, takes decent enough pictures, can get through the day on a single charge, and won't break the bank or double one's monthly mobile bill for the next 2 years.  Tech enthusiasts need not apply.However, as a tech enthusiast who bought one of these as a second phone, I could see myself dailying the Pixel 6a without too many regrets.  I mean, I would feel guilty for coming down hard on it in any particular category simply because it's so darn affordable (particularly when it's on sale).  Plus, there's really nothing else in this price range I can recommend to others with any confidence.  What else can you get for around $300 that is this well-rounded?  In the US?  Not much, though you can get some cheapo Motorola phones for less if you're willing to settle for a weak processor, mediocre cameras, an LCD display (rather than OLED), and a cheaper-feeling, all-plastic build.  You'll also have to settle for weaker software support than the Pixel, which guarantees security updates for another 4 years from now (as well as two more Android OS updates after 13).The nearest competitor is probably the Samsung Galaxy A53 (soon to be A54).  It's also on sale regularly, though I've never seen it as low as the 6a has been.  The Sammy does give you a better display (120Hz AMOLED vs 60Hz OLED) and a bigger battery than the Pixel, but it has a weaker Exynos CPU and worse cameras despite the more impressive specs on paper.  I'd take the Pixel 6a hands down, and that's coming from an 11-year Samsung Galaxy fan.Anyway, onto my detailed personal critique of the Pixel 6a...As I said before, I can't really knock it much considering the price point.  HOWEVER, there are a few sore spots that annoy me and will hopefully be improved upon with the upcoming 7a.The first is the display.  While I appreciate the inclusion of an OLED panel at this price, the 60Hz refresh rate makes my eyes bleed while scrolling.  Harsh?  Yeah, but I've been spoiled by 120Hz displays for years now.  Jumping between this and my S22 Ultra regularly makes the difference even more noticeable.  The 7a is supposed to bump it up to 90Hz, which should greatly improve smoothness.  Refresh rate aside, I also find the display to be a bit on the dim side.  Not that it isn't bright enough in most cases (aside from direct sunlight), but even indoors with minimal lighting the display will adjust to about 50% brightness to maintain adequate visibility.  Meanwhile, my Samsung phones (S22 Ultra and old S21+) are only at 25% brightness in the same environment and still somehow appear to be brighter.  And the colors never seem to pop as much on this phone compared to other OLED-equipped phones I've used.  I suppose that's a key difference between OLED and AMOLED.The second issue is the durability of the materials used to make this phone, mainly the plastic on the back panel.  When brand new, the plastic back does an incredible job of imitating the appearance and feel of glass.  But after minimal use (and even inside of a case, as another reviewer pointed out), this material reveals itself to be ridiculously soft and prone to nicks and scratches.  Mine is covered in little pock marks and micro abrasions despite being in a case the majority of its life.  It's so soft that I swear the little nicks in it are probably from dust particles being pressed into it by popping a case on.  Another ding goes to the dated Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display that's also prone to scratches and sounds really thin and hollow when tapped.  I recommend a screen protector.While steady software updates since the phone's release last July have greatly improved the overall user experience, it still suffers from a few hardware-related headaches.  The modem used in this thing (and its siblings) is infamous for being inefficient, having mediocre reception (though I haven't noticed), and creating massive amounts of heat.  Sadly, no amount of updates can remedy that situation.  It's fine as long as you stick to LTE, in my experience.  Enabling 5G pretty much guarantees that your battery will drain much more quickly and that the back of the phone will stay warm at all times.  On the bright side, you can put it in your back pocket and use it as a ""butt warmer"" on cold days.  If you get a second 6a, you can heat both cheeks evenly.  Don't have heated seats in your car?  Problem solved.  Jokes aside, at least the fingerprint reader and random idle battery drain issues that I experienced early on have been fixed.  It's been months since I've gone to bed with 100% battery only to wake up with 65% left for no reason other than ""just Pixel things"" as a friend of mine with a 6 Pro would call little irritating bugs like those.Now that I've done nothing but blast this poor thing in the previous few paragraphs, let me tell you what I think is great about it.For one, I love the size.  While many out there still think it's too large, I think it's perfect.  After handling a behemoth like the S22 Ultra, this one is a pleasure to grasp even while in a case (of which I recommend the Spigen Rugged Armor, but that's another review).  It's just so light and easy to grip compared to what I'm used to.  It's no Zenfone 9 or iPhone 13 Mini, but it feels downright tiny compared to an S22/23 Ultra or Pixel 6/7 Pro.  Folks with small hands or who simply prefer smaller phones will like this one.  This is the compact option in the realm of budget and mid-range phones, as most inexpensive smartphones have 6.5""+ screens for some reason (I guess they're cheaper to make?).The Pixel software perks are probably my second favorite ""feature"" (though I'm not sure if size can be called a feature...well, maybe but nvm).  Being able to see the title and artist of just about any song playing around me at a glance is something I never knew I wanted.  And while I haven't used them personally, the call waiting assistance and Direct My Call (on-screen choices for automated calls) features sound amazing for simplifying a few of life's little annoyances.  I'm sure there's a lot of great things I'm forgetting to mention but those stand out the most for me.Finally, there's the cameras.  Nothing about the hardware here is fancy or premium, or even new.  In fact, the 6a's main image sensor (Sony IMX363) has been used in the Pixel line as far back as the Pixel 3.  What's propping up these tiny, dated image sensors is Google's amazing camera software and image processing.  While the images produced by this combo won't blow you away, you'll be impressed by just how competent and ""honest"" the results are.  The colors and details are very muted and realistic.  If you're fond of the super-colorful, oversharpened, Ultra HDR photos your typical Samsung phone cranks out, you'll be very disappointed by this phone (and Pixels in general) and should look elsewhere.  I actually prefer the main and ultra-wide cameras on this Pixel to my S22 Ultra for the simple fact that it's better at quick, point and shoot photography.  I can whip the 6a out of my pocket, snap a quick photo, and be 100% confident that resulting picture will be serviceable.  I can't say that about any Samsung that I've ever used.  The main con is the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.  You can zoom up to 7X with the main camera, but your pictures start looking like watercolor paintings at that level of zoom.  I'd go no higher than 3X and even that is pushing it.Other notes to close out this lengthy, rambling review:Speakers are just okay, and the volume slider has to be cranked fairly high to produce enough sound for normal listening.Battery life is fine, but should honestly be better with a 4410 mAh battery onboard.  In a regular day of use for me, I average about 4-5 hours of screen on time with 5G enabled.I can squeeze out an extra hour or two if I disable 5G and stick to LTE, and the phone runs much cooler on average as an added bonus.  I had a OnePlus 8T with a similarly-sized 4500 mAh battery and snapdragon 865 that could get up to 8 hours of SoT (with 5G disabled, as well), so I feel like the Tensor G1 isn't the most efficient SoC around.Charging is slow, coming from someone who used to daily a OnePlus with 65W Warp Charging.  Still, you can fully charge it in less than 2 hours from nearly-dead.  Could be worse, I guess.  Also, there's no wireless charging on the 6a.As far as performance goes, I can't complain about it in daily use scenarios.  It feels very responsive when opening and navigating my usual apps (Gmail, Twitter, twitch, YouTube, Amazon, etc.).  I'm not a phone gamer, so I can't comment on gaming performance though I imagine that it gets rather hot in a short period of time as that's just what the Tensor does.I've already stated repeatedly that I can recommend this phone to just about anyone because it does just about everything well enough for the average person.  However, the 7a is on the horizon and is expected to bring a 90Hz display, wireless charging, the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7, and better cameras for a similar RRP.  While it won't be as affordable as the discounted 6a when it launches this summer, I imagine we'll be seeing it in the $300 range by Black Friday.  So you may want to wait for that one unless you need a new phone right now.  Still, the 6a at its current price is an absolute bargain, in my honest opinion.","The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",2023-03-22,4.0,R2IRNTEPVHZ7G4,TS,69.0,"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),2022-08-04,3.0

I contribute the drops to the receiver unit in the phone. I have two Motorola cells and both have good receiver capabilities. Wifi is both 5g and 2.4g and again, great speedy connection.

I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

My review:Size: this phone is at least 30% larger than my old phone. Fortunately I do not carry it around often so it probably won't be a major issue. However, if you are looking for a portable phone that will fit in a regular pocket, be aware.Set up: tracfone support was useless. They wanted to send me a code to complete the set up, but my old phone was broken so they said they could not, nor did they offer any other options. Fortunately, my adult son switched the sim card from my old phone into the new one and i was able to receive the code on my new phone and complete the process. Without him I would still not have a functional phone.Charging cable: phone did not come with a functional charging cable and to use the one that was sent would have required another purchase. I ended up using the cable from my Fire tablet, which sufficed.Performance: as always there is a learning curve with new technology but so far i am feeling my way along with this phone. Don't expect to receive a user manual because one does not come with this phone. Downloaded one from the internet but it is poorly written and not user friendly. You Tube videos are available for some issues, however. So far the phone seems to be working ok.Lost data: i am still trying to figure out if I can retrieve my contacts, photos, etc from my old phone to transfer to new phone. I probably won't even bother to do this thru tracfone because I'm sure it would only frustrate me and make me want to kill myself.

B0BCQXXRJJ,Google Pixel 7-5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with Wide Angle Lens and 24-Hour Battery - 128GB - Obsidian,495.0,4.3,3000,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0BCQXXRJJ/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,RE4ER1P5QMX1S,4.0,Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,13.0,R33OZ0QVN7YS8Q,4.0,Better Value than a Galaxy S23,96.0,R506S9F5UZDED,5.0,Great phone and cheap price!!!,0.0,R3VCN7DUWEMOFF,5.0,Good Value,0.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,3.0,"Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",108.0,RE4ER1P5QMX1S,Realm of Nova,13.0,"As a longtime user of Pixel phones, I can't help but keep coming back to them even when I try a different phone, except this time.While the Pixel 7 continues to be one of the best value options on the market, my Pixel arrived with a faint but noticeable screen defect in which there were three shadow-like gray areas in the top, middle, and bottom portions of the screen that were very noticeable on bright backgrounds. This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,2023-09-10,4.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,TJ,108.0,"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this","Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",2022-11-16,3.0

It does not have NFC though.ConsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a low screen resolution compared to other phones in its price range. It also has thick bezels around the display, which reduce the screen-to-body ratio.The phone does not have a dedicated microSD slot, but uses a hybrid SIM slot instead. This means that users have to choose between dual SIM or extra storage.The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which may disappoint some users who prefer wired headphones. It also does not have stereo speakers or Dolby Atmos support.ConclusionThe Umidigi G1 Max is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers some impressive specs for its price. It has a large display, a powerful camera, a huge battery, and Android 12. It also has ample RAM and storage space, and supports global bands. All around a great device that checks in much higher performance wise than the low price tag would otherwise indicate!!",Fantastic Budget Option Android That Punches Above It's Weight Class With Features,2023-05-25,5.0,R3KDM6LHGWP8EC,Ron Novak,6.0,"See edits belowI bought the G 1 Max to replace another old phone. Had already bought an UMIDGI Bison 2 Pro, WHICH WORKS WITH VERIZON. I checked the specs on the G 1 Max, looked the same as the Bison. When I got it, I checked out the G 1 AND IT DOESN'T WORK (voice and text) WITH VERIZON..... Well, why? After an hour talking to a Verizon Tech Person, I think I know. The write-up says it doesn't work with CDMA providers like Verizon, but Verizon has discontinued CDMA. So that is meaningless. They use 4 G LTE now... This phone uses 4 G LTE, so it must work.... NOT! Verizon uses 4 G LTE with VOLTE, Voice Over LTE..... So to work with Verizon the device has to have VOLTE.. The Bison 2 Pro has it (just try to find it in the specs!), and it's good with Verizon, the G 1 Max doesn't and it doesn't work....... Connects, but no texts or voice.....This is too bad, since the G 1Max is a really nice phone. I would like to find one like it that works with Verizon. And it helps that it's half the price of the Bison 2 Pro. I'm on my second Bison, the screen on the first went black and white and started flashing on and off.... We'll see how the second holds up.Guess I'll have to do more research on the pathetic UMIDGI website to find all their 4 G, VOLTE devices....... Happy hunting!EDIT 1Looking at the glitzy UMIDIGI website dazzles the eye but doesn’t tell you much, like all sales pitches. HOWEVER, looking at the specs for a similar device to the G1 MAX, the C1 MAX, (they are lumped together) it look as if the C1 does support VOLTE. That said, the specs of the two devices are lumped together, but the G1 does not have VOLTE. So, I am going to order the C1 MAX and see if it actually works on Verizon. I commented to the techs at UMIDIGI that they ought to segregate the devices by generation and have a category for VOLTE since it seems to be the deciding factor in whether a device works with Verizon. Don’t hold your breath! Stay tuned for the next edit!Edit 2Neither the C1 nor the G1 is likely to work with Verizon. With a lot of research and an hour with a Verizon “technician”, I have come to the conclusion that in order for a cellphone to work with Verizon, two things are necessary; First, the phone has to use VOLTE, and Second, it has to use bands 2, 4, AND 13! (This is for 4G only) Neither the C1 nor the G1 has band 13, and they probably won’t work. I checked the specs of 11 Umidgi phones and bought an A11 to check this hypothesis out. It has both VOLTE and bands 2, 4, and 13. AND IT WORKS FINE WITH VERIZON!!!!! And it is priced at ~$109!!!!!! So check the specs and don’t get stuck……..Edit 3I have upgraded my rating to 3 stars since I think that the G1 Max is a fine phone, it just doesn't work with Verizon....... The experience I had with it otherwise (GPS, cruising the internet, etc) was a good one. Like I indicated, I wish the phone worked with Verizon! The build quality is good and it is a bargain!","DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON, PERIOD!!!!!! See edit",2023-03-02,3.0

Great/Easy first time setup!+Great stereo Speakers, great sound very loud and clear!+ It corrects grammar as well as spelling ...Now the Minuses:- There isn't hardly any apps to run audio or video files so I had to install VLC but still cannot see the audio files while playing them,  unless I use the volume control and grab it before it disappears.-The screen comes ON with slightest movement (despite the fact that I changed the Settings and told it Not to)!

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

READ THIS!,17.0,RH2T1GVHU3KQ4,5.0,Great phone,3.0,R10E07I4RWKZZN,Kevin Smith,10.0,"I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

For the same price as taking this to a local shop and having them fix my Pixel I could just buy this phone and have Google fix the issue for free.After a few days of use, I have to admit that I could totally daily drive this phone. It's got a surprisingly good screen. The 90hz setting makes it pretty smooth and the colors and brightness are decent. It fades pretty fast at angles, but I'm not going to get picky about that for $150 (it was on sale).As far as performance, it's really good. Coming from a flagship android phone to this, I notice a hiccup or stutter here and there, but it's 80% of the way there for a quarter of the price. The camera is pretty good too, not flagship quality, but far from a potato. It's got a mono speaker which is lacking a bit in bass, but unless you've got an iPhone I think every phone is going to be lacking there.So, if you've got $200 to spend (or less as I got it at a $50 discount here on Amazon), this is an amazingly good bargain.

As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.",Better than Almost Every Flagship Phone,2023-09-10,4.0,R2QXDXGCOFG39C,three_legs,2.0,"First off I like this camera. 30x is actually amazing.However, without access to MSM and edl firehose etc I am kinda disappointed.Basically if you brick your device doing any development there are two options open it up to do a hardware jumper bypass or send it back to OnePlus. The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard. I apologize to Amazon but I'll have to send this one back I'll probably be buying an even older OnePlus.",Read if you're a developer.,2023-06-17,3.0

I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking.

Unlike many people I can't justify spending more than $200 on a phone that is likely to be dropped/broken/malfunctioning within a couple years. Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they'd just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their 'tap to wake' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.","Overall good phone, fast hardware. Mediocre moto software",2023-08-31,4.0,R2LFWQSME0K77O,Heimish Reviews,0.0,"There are a couple design flaws.  First, the speaker is at the bottom of the phone. I tended to rest it on my chest while talking on speaker phone and the speaker was muffled by my shirt.  It also had pointy edges along the part where the speaker opening is at the bottom. It was uncomfortable and bulky to hold while trying to talk or watch videos. The part that was most annoying is that it kept disconnecting from the wifi and without knowing that it had, I ended up using up all of my 5g of data for the month in one day.  Every time I would reconnect to wifi, it would drop again. After a week I just had enough and returned the phone.  With the case I bought it was also too heavy for the magnetic phone holder and would just slide off.  The fingerprint reader was also not easy to access, especially with the case on. Overall, just poorly designed and non ergonomic. One of my worst experiences with a new phone.",Not the best design and wifi kept dropping,2023-08-23,3.0
B0B3PSRHHN,Google Pixel 6a - 5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with 12 Megapixel Camera and 24-Hour Battery - Charcoal,339.99,4.3,5200,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B3PSRHHN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,4.0,"The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",189.0,R3AAKHR07NTT1B,5.0,More than meets my needs,24.0,R4KHL0ERH66X7,4.0,Solid phone so far and I'm very pleased with it,1.0,R3840XP5ER7LXA,4.0,"For the price, there isn't a better option!",0.0,R1EJ4Q5CVD6V2Z,4.0,"Moving on from Moto G line, great alternative",47.0,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,Thomas Hicks,189.0,"TLDR:  The Pixel 6a is a phone that I can safely recommend to anyone who just wants a device that works, takes decent enough pictures, can get through the day on a single charge, and won't break the bank or double one's monthly mobile bill for the next 2 years.  Tech enthusiasts need not apply.However, as a tech enthusiast who bought one of these as a second phone, I could see myself dailying the Pixel 6a without too many regrets.  I mean, I would feel guilty for coming down hard on it in any particular category simply because it's so darn affordable (particularly when it's on sale).  Plus, there's really nothing else in this price range I can recommend to others with any confidence.  What else can you get for around $300 that is this well-rounded?  In the US?  Not much, though you can get some cheapo Motorola phones for less if you're willing to settle for a weak processor, mediocre cameras, an LCD display (rather than OLED), and a cheaper-feeling, all-plastic build.  You'll also have to settle for weaker software support than the Pixel, which guarantees security updates for another 4 years from now (as well as two more Android OS updates after 13).The nearest competitor is probably the Samsung Galaxy A53 (soon to be A54).  It's also on sale regularly, though I've never seen it as low as the 6a has been.  The Sammy does give you a better display (120Hz AMOLED vs 60Hz OLED) and a bigger battery than the Pixel, but it has a weaker Exynos CPU and worse cameras despite the more impressive specs on paper.  I'd take the Pixel 6a hands down, and that's coming from an 11-year Samsung Galaxy fan.Anyway, onto my detailed personal critique of the Pixel 6a...As I said before, I can't really knock it much considering the price point.  HOWEVER, there are a few sore spots that annoy me and will hopefully be improved upon with the upcoming 7a.The first is the display.  While I appreciate the inclusion of an OLED panel at this price, the 60Hz refresh rate makes my eyes bleed while scrolling.  Harsh?  Yeah, but I've been spoiled by 120Hz displays for years now.  Jumping between this and my S22 Ultra regularly makes the difference even more noticeable.  The 7a is supposed to bump it up to 90Hz, which should greatly improve smoothness.  Refresh rate aside, I also find the display to be a bit on the dim side.  Not that it isn't bright enough in most cases (aside from direct sunlight), but even indoors with minimal lighting the display will adjust to about 50% brightness to maintain adequate visibility.  Meanwhile, my Samsung phones (S22 Ultra and old S21+) are only at 25% brightness in the same environment and still somehow appear to be brighter.  And the colors never seem to pop as much on this phone compared to other OLED-equipped phones I've used.  I suppose that's a key difference between OLED and AMOLED.The second issue is the durability of the materials used to make this phone, mainly the plastic on the back panel.  When brand new, the plastic back does an incredible job of imitating the appearance and feel of glass.  But after minimal use (and even inside of a case, as another reviewer pointed out), this material reveals itself to be ridiculously soft and prone to nicks and scratches.  Mine is covered in little pock marks and micro abrasions despite being in a case the majority of its life.  It's so soft that I swear the little nicks in it are probably from dust particles being pressed into it by popping a case on.  Another ding goes to the dated Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display that's also prone to scratches and sounds really thin and hollow when tapped.  I recommend a screen protector.While steady software updates since the phone's release last July have greatly improved the overall user experience, it still suffers from a few hardware-related headaches.  The modem used in this thing (and its siblings) is infamous for being inefficient, having mediocre reception (though I haven't noticed), and creating massive amounts of heat.  Sadly, no amount of updates can remedy that situation.  It's fine as long as you stick to LTE, in my experience.  Enabling 5G pretty much guarantees that your battery will drain much more quickly and that the back of the phone will stay warm at all times.  On the bright side, you can put it in your back pocket and use it as a ""butt warmer"" on cold days.  If you get a second 6a, you can heat both cheeks evenly.  Don't have heated seats in your car?  Problem solved.  Jokes aside, at least the fingerprint reader and random idle battery drain issues that I experienced early on have been fixed.  It's been months since I've gone to bed with 100% battery only to wake up with 65% left for no reason other than ""just Pixel things"" as a friend of mine with a 6 Pro would call little irritating bugs like those.Now that I've done nothing but blast this poor thing in the previous few paragraphs, let me tell you what I think is great about it.For one, I love the size.  While many out there still think it's too large, I think it's perfect.  After handling a behemoth like the S22 Ultra, this one is a pleasure to grasp even while in a case (of which I recommend the Spigen Rugged Armor, but that's another review).  It's just so light and easy to grip compared to what I'm used to.  It's no Zenfone 9 or iPhone 13 Mini, but it feels downright tiny compared to an S22/23 Ultra or Pixel 6/7 Pro.  Folks with small hands or who simply prefer smaller phones will like this one.  This is the compact option in the realm of budget and mid-range phones, as most inexpensive smartphones have 6.5""+ screens for some reason (I guess they're cheaper to make?).The Pixel software perks are probably my second favorite ""feature"" (though I'm not sure if size can be called a feature...well, maybe but nvm).  Being able to see the title and artist of just about any song playing around me at a glance is something I never knew I wanted.  And while I haven't used them personally, the call waiting assistance and Direct My Call (on-screen choices for automated calls) features sound amazing for simplifying a few of life's little annoyances.  I'm sure there's a lot of great things I'm forgetting to mention but those stand out the most for me.Finally, there's the cameras.  Nothing about the hardware here is fancy or premium, or even new.  In fact, the 6a's main image sensor (Sony IMX363) has been used in the Pixel line as far back as the Pixel 3.  What's propping up these tiny, dated image sensors is Google's amazing camera software and image processing.  While the images produced by this combo won't blow you away, you'll be impressed by just how competent and ""honest"" the results are.  The colors and details are very muted and realistic.  If you're fond of the super-colorful, oversharpened, Ultra HDR photos your typical Samsung phone cranks out, you'll be very disappointed by this phone (and Pixels in general) and should look elsewhere.  I actually prefer the main and ultra-wide cameras on this Pixel to my S22 Ultra for the simple fact that it's better at quick, point and shoot photography.  I can whip the 6a out of my pocket, snap a quick photo, and be 100% confident that resulting picture will be serviceable.  I can't say that about any Samsung that I've ever used.  The main con is the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.  You can zoom up to 7X with the main camera, but your pictures start looking like watercolor paintings at that level of zoom.  I'd go no higher than 3X and even that is pushing it.Other notes to close out this lengthy, rambling review:Speakers are just okay, and the volume slider has to be cranked fairly high to produce enough sound for normal listening.Battery life is fine, but should honestly be better with a 4410 mAh battery onboard.  In a regular day of use for me, I average about 4-5 hours of screen on time with 5G enabled.I can squeeze out an extra hour or two if I disable 5G and stick to LTE, and the phone runs much cooler on average as an added bonus.  I had a OnePlus 8T with a similarly-sized 4500 mAh battery and snapdragon 865 that could get up to 8 hours of SoT (with 5G disabled, as well), so I feel like the Tensor G1 isn't the most efficient SoC around.Charging is slow, coming from someone who used to daily a OnePlus with 65W Warp Charging.  Still, you can fully charge it in less than 2 hours from nearly-dead.  Could be worse, I guess.  Also, there's no wireless charging on the 6a.As far as performance goes, I can't complain about it in daily use scenarios.  It feels very responsive when opening and navigating my usual apps (Gmail, Twitter, twitch, YouTube, Amazon, etc.).  I'm not a phone gamer, so I can't comment on gaming performance though I imagine that it gets rather hot in a short period of time as that's just what the Tensor does.I've already stated repeatedly that I can recommend this phone to just about anyone because it does just about everything well enough for the average person.  However, the 7a is on the horizon and is expected to bring a 90Hz display, wireless charging, the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7, and better cameras for a similar RRP.  While it won't be as affordable as the discounted 6a when it launches this summer, I imagine we'll be seeing it in the $300 range by Black Friday.  So you may want to wait for that one unless you need a new phone right now.  Still, the 6a at its current price is an absolute bargain, in my honest opinion.","The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",2023-03-22,4.0,R2IRNTEPVHZ7G4,TS,69.0,"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),2022-08-04,3.0

Of course, I don't know about longevity, but if this phone continues for a year or so as it is now it will above 5 stars to me. I've had this about 2 weeks. I tried 2 other phones and returned them without any hassle. Thank you Amazon. But this phone was under $200 and I'm very happy with it. The 6 gb ram is very efficient and the 256 gb storage is more than enough plus I get to keep photos and docs on an SD card.

I contribute the drops to the receiver unit in the phone. I have two Motorola cells and both have good receiver capabilities. Wifi is both 5g and 2.4g and again, great speedy connection.

READ THIS!,17.0,RH2T1GVHU3KQ4,5.0,Great phone,3.0,R10E07I4RWKZZN,Kevin Smith,10.0,"I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

However, if you are looking for a portable phone that will fit in a regular pocket, be aware.Set up: tracfone support was useless. They wanted to send me a code to complete the set up, but my old phone was broken so they said they could not, nor did they offer any other options. Fortunately, my adult son switched the sim card from my old phone into the new one and i was able to receive the code on my new phone and complete the process. Without him I would still not have a functional phone.Charging cable: phone did not come with a functional charging cable and to use the one that was sent would have required another purchase. I ended up using the cable from my Fire tablet, which sufficed.Performance: as always there is a learning curve with new technology but so far i am feeling my way along with this phone. Don't expect to receive a user manual because one does not come with this phone. Downloaded one from the internet but it is poorly written and not user friendly.

This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,2023-09-10,4.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,TJ,108.0,"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this","Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.",2022-11-16,3.0

See edit",6.0,R2RHWRA4J23DMT,Briguy Rides,7.0,"Umidigi G1 Max Review: A Budget Phone with Impressive Specs:  I ordered this phone directly from Umidigi and received it very quickly, I have been using the device for almost a month now and wanted to leave a review to share my thoughts along with some benchmark scores from ANTUTU testing.The Umidigi G1 Max is a mid-range smartphone that offers some impressive features for its price. It has a large 6.52-inch IPS display, a 50MP main camera, a 5150mAh battery, and runs on Android 12. It also comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. The phone is powered by the Unisoc Tiger T610 octa-core processor, which delivers decent performance and efficiency.  All setup and app operations were performed smoothly and without and issues.  I experienced no crashes or other negative performance issues throughout my time using this device.ProsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a sleek and stylish design, with a right-angle frame and a glossy back. It comes in two colors: Galaxy Blue and Starry Black. I received the Galaxy Blue and found this finish to be really quality and not a fingerprint magnet.  Also Super Bonus, the device was delivered with a case which is awesome!The phone has a large and immersive display, with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a waterdrop notch. The screen has a resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels, which is adequate for watching videos and browsing the web.The phone has a powerful 50MP main camera, which can capture detailed and vivid photos in various scenarios. It also has a 2MP depth camera for portrait mode, and an 8MP selfie camera. The phone supports night mode, HDR, panorama, and 1080p video recording. I had no issues watching videos or editing photos all were done with speed and ease.The phone has a massive 5150mAh battery, which can last for more than a day of moderate use. It also supports fast charging with a 10W charger included in the box. - I never had an issue with the battery running out before a full day of use which I cannot say the same for other devices I have used lately.The phone runs on Android 12, which offers enhanced privacy features, dynamic personalization, and faster app startup. The phone also has minimal bloatware and offers a smooth user experience.The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and face unlock, which are fast and convenient to use. It also has other sensors such as accelerometer, proximity, and compass.The phone supports global bands, dual SIM, dual standby, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, and USB Type-C. It does not have NFC though.ConsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a low screen resolution compared to other phones in its price range. It also has thick bezels around the display, which reduce the screen-to-body ratio.The phone does not have a dedicated microSD slot, but uses a hybrid SIM slot instead. This means that users have to choose between dual SIM or extra storage.The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which may disappoint some users who prefer wired headphones. It also does not have stereo speakers or Dolby Atmos support.ConclusionThe Umidigi G1 Max is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers some impressive specs for its price. It has a large display, a powerful camera, a huge battery, and Android 12. It also has ample RAM and storage space, and supports global bands. All around a great device that checks in much higher performance wise than the low price tag would otherwise indicate!!",Fantastic Budget Option Android That Punches Above It's Weight Class With Features,2023-05-25,5.0,R3KDM6LHGWP8EC,Ron Novak,6.0,"See edits belowI bought the G 1 Max to replace another old phone. Had already bought an UMIDGI Bison 2 Pro, WHICH WORKS WITH VERIZON. I checked the specs on the G 1 Max, looked the same as the Bison. When I got it, I checked out the G 1 AND IT DOESN'T WORK (voice and text) WITH VERIZON..... Well, why? After an hour talking to a Verizon Tech Person, I think I know. The write-up says it doesn't work with CDMA providers like Verizon, but Verizon has discontinued CDMA. So that is meaningless. They use 4 G LTE now... This phone uses 4 G LTE, so it must work.... NOT! Verizon uses 4 G LTE with VOLTE, Voice Over LTE..... So to work with Verizon the device has to have VOLTE.. The Bison 2 Pro has it (just try to find it in the specs!), and it's good with Verizon, the G 1 Max doesn't and it doesn't work....... Connects, but no texts or voice.....This is too bad, since the G 1Max is a really nice phone. I would like to find one like it that works with Verizon. And it helps that it's half the price of the Bison 2 Pro. I'm on my second Bison, the screen on the first went black and white and started flashing on and off.... We'll see how the second holds up.Guess I'll have to do more research on the pathetic UMIDGI website to find all their 4 G, VOLTE devices....... Happy hunting!EDIT 1Looking at the glitzy UMIDIGI website dazzles the eye but doesn’t tell you much, like all sales pitches. HOWEVER, looking at the specs for a similar device to the G1 MAX, the C1 MAX, (they are lumped together) it look as if the C1 does support VOLTE. That said, the specs of the two devices are lumped together, but the G1 does not have VOLTE. So, I am going to order the C1 MAX and see if it actually works on Verizon. I commented to the techs at UMIDIGI that they ought to segregate the devices by generation and have a category for VOLTE since it seems to be the deciding factor in whether a device works with Verizon. Don’t hold your breath! Stay tuned for the next edit!Edit 2Neither the C1 nor the G1 is likely to work with Verizon. With a lot of research and an hour with a Verizon “technician”, I have come to the conclusion that in order for a cellphone to work with Verizon, two things are necessary; First, the phone has to use VOLTE, and Second, it has to use bands 2, 4, AND 13! (This is for 4G only) Neither the C1 nor the G1 has band 13, and they probably won’t work. I checked the specs of 11 Umidgi phones and bought an A11 to check this hypothesis out. It has both VOLTE and bands 2, 4, and 13. AND IT WORKS FINE WITH VERIZON!!!!! And it is priced at ~$109!!!!!! So check the specs and don’t get stuck……..Edit 3I have upgraded my rating to 3 stars since I think that the G1 Max is a fine phone, it just doesn't work with Verizon....... The experience I had with it otherwise (GPS, cruising the internet, etc) was a good one. Like I indicated, I wish the phone worked with Verizon! The build quality is good and it is a bargain!","DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON, PERIOD!!!!!! See edit",2023-03-02,3.0

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

READ THIS!,17.0,RH2T1GVHU3KQ4,5.0,Great phone,3.0,R10E07I4RWKZZN,Kevin Smith,10.0,"I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

It's got a surprisingly good screen. The 90hz setting makes it pretty smooth and the colors and brightness are decent. It fades pretty fast at angles, but I'm not going to get picky about that for $150 (it was on sale).As far as performance, it's really good.

As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.",Better than Almost Every Flagship Phone,2023-09-10,4.0,R2QXDXGCOFG39C,three_legs,2.0,"First off I like this camera. 30x is actually amazing.However, without access to MSM and edl firehose etc I am kinda disappointed.Basically if you brick your device doing any development there are two options open it up to do a hardware jumper bypass or send it back to OnePlus. The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard. I apologize to Amazon but I'll have to send this one back I'll probably be buying an even older OnePlus.",Read if you're a developer.,2023-06-17,3.0

So, regardless of how large your SD card is, you're still limited to the internal storage for apps, etc.Lastly, try as I may, could NOT find a way to change the default directories to the SD card, such as download, pictures, music, etc. You can only move them manually, after the fact.I don't blame the seller; they didn't make the phone.

Packaging is nice, comes with a brief, clearly written user manual which I used right away to see how to change the sound options. I use a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, and I took these buds out of the package, directly out of the case and put them right in. The default female voice told me they were powered on right away, sounding in both ears, in the order i put them in. Opened bluetooth options on my phone and they were already listed as ""Raycon Everyday Buds."" I touched the name and they connected right off without any issue whatsoever. Hit play on my music, and I love the sound. I just opened them today, so I'm waiting to see how these endure before giving full stars.The button in each bud is a physical push button, a bubble that clicks. I like it because the sweaty strap from my bike helmet won't press it inadvertently like my old buds that just had ""touch control."" You can't see the bud when you reach up to touch it, so it's always a game of fumbling with where to touch it and how many ""touches"" would register. Especially when on the mountain bike, that frustrated me, but maybe you like it (wierdo)...Sound quality:I love all three modes. ""Balanced, Bass and Pure"" they all sound good while bringing in their individual strengths. For piano pieces, like Paul Cardall or Ludivico Eiunadi, Pure Sound is precise. For Van Halen, Nightwish, and Godsmack, Balanced sound and Bass modes are excellent. It's all subjective anyway, but I can hear the details and fairly crisp sounds.Awareness Mode:This is my first time trying buds that have a mode where they claim to allow you to hear ambient noise around you while still enjoying the music. Raycon calls it ""Awareness Mode"". It works, but not as i had hoped. In my mind, I had anticipated being able to speak while listening to my music and hear my voice and others' clearly through the electronic mic instead of through jawbone vibrations like when you plug your ears with your fingers and speak. These buds can do that, but you can only hear it faintly, and I find myself wishing I could turn up that volume. But if I turn it up, only the music gets louder and the ambient sounds are left behind as the music grows in volume. The ambient sound volume is constant, and only works well if I turn the music off. Which is a disapponting feature because then what's the point? Without the music, I might as well remove the buds right? All buds claim to have powerful noise canceling, but what I'm hoping for is exactly the opposite, I want to hear my music and all the ambient sounds while biking, running, and working at my computer. It should be like hearing the world around me but with cool music that nobody else can hear. Why isn't this an option? Maybe I'm the wierdo.The fit is okay... It comes with multiple gel sizes. The default sizes were a bit tight, so I downsized them by one, and they are comfortable for about 15 minutes then I have to push them in again. Not quite settled on which size of gel I should be using. This shouldn't be that difficult but...UPDATE: 8/24/22I've had them for over a month now. Still working as they did they day I opened them.*The container charges in just a couple hours*The longest I have had these in is about 5 hours, my ears became fatigued from the fit before the battery ran out while I was backpacking. The buds charged up and container still had more than 50%*PHONE CALLS: I haven't had problems hearing clear audio from the phone calls. When I ask the other caller how I sound they have told me I'm difficult to hear well. If i turn off Bluetooth and speak directly into the phone they report my sound as being much better. Not impressed with the microphone quality. But I have had no problems at all hearing the other caller clearly.*I have not yet had any connection problems with my phone*I still am disappointed with the Awareness Mode.  It's very underwhelming compared to my daughter's Jabra Elite Active 75 earbuds with the same feature. Those are significantly better in this regard.*I wear these while mountain biking, they stay in fine, but I don't bomb down the mountain either.*I really wish I had the ability to adjust the equalizer settings but it's fixed in stone. The app is a complete joke, no functionality at all. No my friend, if you want to adjust the equalizer, these are not for you. I do wish I could adjust the bass to be more pronounced, and the highs to be a bit sharper.12/2/2022 UPDATE: over 1 year ownership..I still have these and they still work as described above, they hold charge forever. But at this point I'm ready for a different pair just because of the phone call quality and the weak awareness mode.

As they say, ""You get what you pay for,"" and this phone perfectly embodies that sentiment. If you're looking for a budget-friendly device that covers the basics, the A03 might be an option to consider. However, be prepared to deal with its frustratingly sluggish performance.Pros:✅ Budget-Friendly: One of the most appealing aspects of the Samsung A03 is undoubtedly its price. It's a wallet-friendly option for those who need a smartphone but don't want to break the bank.✅ Decent Display: The display is adequate for everyday tasks such as checking emails, browsing social media, and watching videos. The colors are decent, and the screen size is comfortable.Cons:❌ Sluggish Performance: The most significant drawback of the A03 is its painfully slow performance. Apps take forever to open, switching between tasks is a test of patience, and even simple actions like typing can lead to frustrating delays. This sluggishness significantly hampers the overall user experience.❌ Limited Storage: The internal storage on the A03 is quite limited, leaving you with minimal space for apps, photos, and other files. You'll likely find yourself constantly juggling storage to make room for new content.❌ Mediocre Camera: While I didn't expect flagship-level camera quality from a budget phone, the A03's camera still falls short. Photos lack detail and tend to look washed out, especially in low-light conditions.❌ Outdated Software: The A03 comes with an older version of Samsung's software, and updates are infrequent. This not only means missing out on the latest features but also leaves you vulnerable to security risks.Overall Impression:The Samsung A03 is a prime example of the trade-off between price and performance. If you're on a tight budget and need a device for the bare minimum tasks like calls, texts, and occasional browsing, the A03 might serve its purpose. However, if you're looking for a smoother experience, even for basic tasks, I'd recommend saving up a bit more for a more capable phone. The sluggishness and limited features of the A03 can quickly become frustrating, overshadowing its affordable price point. Consider your priorities carefully before making a decision.",Affordable but Slow,2023-08-09,3.0

The phone also comes with other nice features like night vision camera, fm radio, high power flash light, etc, which are all nice pluses, but won't make me so excited about. However in my opinion, the only regret about the phone is that it didn't comes with a 3.5mm audio jack, which are normally found on other doogee phones like s61 or s51.

Unfortunately, they won't update to OxygenOS 13, since it originally shipped under 11.  So I guess my one update was done in the box.  Settings menus are kind of a mess.

I like to cover my camera with tape when I'm not using it, and it's more difficult to do that when the camera is inside the screen - as in, the screen is displaying stuff around the camera lens.  I'd prefer a camera that's under the screen, and but is not displaying anything above it, so it's easier to tape up.Review:I've always avoided OnePlus, because despite their motto of ""Never Settle"", their major lineup has always seemed exactly like settling to me - no microSD slot, nor 3.5mm headphone jack, nor NFC, and other missing basic features, even before the industry sadly started killing some those features off in most phones.  Unfortunately, it's been harder to find phones that meet some of my basic criteria that I just mentioned.  So while I was looking for a new phone, I was pretty interested in trying a OnePlus phone that finally had those things.  For the most part, the phone works great. Rooting was easy enough. The phone is still getting security updates. Calls are clear.  Camera quality is not great, but not terrible. The phone does run a little slow at times, but is pretty responsive for the most part.  HOWEVER, there's a major problem, in my opinion, with the software.  It is the sole reason for me knocking 2 of the stars off. The phone's task killer is stupidly aggressive.  If you don't know, this is the thing on Android that usually manages what apps you have running on your phone, in the foreground and in the background. Whatever app you're looking at & using, is likely in the foreground.  Whatever apps are running, but you're not actively using, such as a music or video player, is likely in the background.  On this phone, that thing is so aggressive, that I can seldom have one app running in the background, let alone more than that.  Trying to play music from a music player, while trying to browse the internet?  Expect your music player in the background to get slaughtered within a few minutes, because the phone's task killer won't allow it.  Switching between 2-3 apps while multi-tasking?  1 or 2 of them will likely get killed, probably resetting whatever you were doing in them.  As you might guess from my comment about rooting, I'm a power user.  I know my way around Android probably way better than the average user.  Before I even rooted, I was suffering from this issue.  I've tried setting every option in the phone that I could find, to not kill certain apps in the background.  Yet none of them seem to have any effect on disabling this ""feature"".  There are root-only solutions for this type of issue, but they also don't fix the problem on this phone. From hours of researching online, I'm not the only one with this complaint.  It seems like whatever is causing this aggressive task killer behavior, is ingrained deep in OnePlus's badly designed operating system. From what I've read, this aggressive task killing behavior is also oddly normal for OnePlus's operating systems on most of their phones, which I wish I would've known before buying this phone.  Also, the music player is just one example.  There are various other apps that I like to setup to run in the background and do certain things.  And they keep closing & failing, because of the overly aggressive task killer.  I think maybe it's OnePlus's way of hiding the phone's slow performance, by not allowing anything in the background to slow it down.  It is such a massive shame, because this one major issue, absolutely ruins the phone for me.  $300 for a phone with an issue like this, is an absurd price. I think $150 is more reasonable, until this issue is fixed.  I've used plenty of $100 phones, that work better, without the need to kill apps so aggressively. Some of the customizability options in the OnePlus system's settings are also more limited than the average Android phone that I've used, so the software just seems to be poorly designed in general.I really want to support companies that continue producing phones with micro SD cards, 3.5mm headphone jacks, easy rootability, heck, removable batteries, if we could get those back.  Those features are becoming harder & harder to find, and I consider them essential, far more than some gimmick on other phones, like a 100MP camera, or having 4 camera lens. But unfortunately, despite the decent hardware on the OnePlus Nord, the software still very much feels like settling.","Decent hardware, horrible software",2023-05-28,2.0

I then signed up for a TracFone plan. I purchased the unlimited talk and text, and 2 GB plan. The reason I went with TracFone is because they have rollover minutes. My typical use of data is 1 GB per month. Therefore I thought I would be rolling over 1 GB each month. I just paid for my February plan on the 28th, so I should have 2 GB and whatever's left for rollover. I currently have .69 rollover GB  and zero new GB. At the bare minimum, I should have 2 GB of new data. And maybe 4 GB of rollover.I received a message that my phone had been unlocked, or was available to be unlocked, after 60 days of having my phone. I don't know if it's unlocked or not. I'm ready to move my phone to a different plan so I can get what I pay for, but the customer service is atrocious for TracFone.I first tried chatting online. I was number 86 in the queue, I waited. The person answered my question that I had .69 GB of data. I asked another question, and he was gone.So I called customer service and waited 25 minutes, the girl came on the phone and I asked her if she could first tell me when did I start my service with tracfone. She informed me she could not give me that information. I was confused! I asked her why she can't she said it's a policy. I said how then am I supposed to know if I have the right amount of rollover minutes. And she said it's a policy I can't tell you. I said well I have another question... And she cut me off.The phone rang, and it rang two rings I couldn't answer it quick enough and it was dead. My guess was that was them calling me back.I kept trying to call them back but it would get answered and then cut off, right away. No human no automated voice. I waited 40 minutes, and then I called again. This time the call went through, I waited 18 minutes. I got a guy named Bill on the phone, he told me you couldn't help me cuz his computer was down. I called again. I got a very helpful lady who told me that my balance was .69 GB. I explained to her that I just purchased 2 GB on February 28th and it's not showing in my system. She came back and was in the middle of answering me and we got cut off. I called back after waiting a long period of time I talked to another person, the system was down and he couldn't help me.I then did a chat through the app. That guy was pretty helpful... But then he got stuck because his system went down.I'm moving my service.... Don't get TracFone! Check out other reviews before you decide. You'll see I'm not the only one having troubles with the rollover minutes. Problem is I didn't read the reviews before I started my adventure with TracFone.Good luck.",Buyer beware,2023-03-05,1.0

I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas.","Horrific battery life, be cautious before you buy",2023-06-30,2.0

However that phone was durable and well made. This phone is cheaply made. Feels like cheap plastic, easily slips out of hand if you don't have a phone case on it. It's a thicker phone so when it vibrates you hear the echo thru the phone. Seems to lag a lot especially when you've been using it for a while. Overheats easily. Also the screen seems to have a mind of it's own. If your just reading something suddenly your phone will be going to the webpage from an ad without you touching anything. The pros are good battery life so far. And it's a 5g phone. I guess the price to because I don't need a $1000+ dollar phone I just need the basics. But compared to my last phone the quality is definitely lacking. Lastly this phone isn't huge but it's a lot bigger than my last phone so holding it with one hand can definitely be uncomfortable after a while so a phone case and ring to hold the phone are a must.",It's okay.,2023-08-17,3.0

Unlike many people I can't justify spending more than $200 on a phone that is likely to be dropped/broken/malfunctioning within a couple years. Unfortunately that means digging through bargain bin phones. As far as this one goes, its pretty good overall. My most recent budget phone before this was a Samsung Galaxy A03sPros:- Much, MUCH faster than the A03s in every possible way- Battery life almost as good as the A03s while still being way faster- Stylus works pretty well and is nice for precision use cases- Screen is real sharp and generally bright enough. 90hz is useless to me so I turn it to 60hz to save batteryOkay:- The camera is 12MP, not ""52"" or whatever they stamp on there. This reminds me of the old days of computer monitors where the size as marketed was edge to edge of the case instead of the screen itself. It has aggressive filtering applied to every photo no matter what settings you change. I am not trying to be a pro photographer with my phone so this doesnt bother me much but I wish they'd just put a non-filtered 12MP camera instead of all this silly marketing ""AI"" mess.Cons:- The moto firmware is mediocre. The ""peek"" function would be better if it just showed the normal lockscreen but no, they had to go and make a less accessible, more annoying version. This makes their 'tap to wake' function, that I normally love on phones, far less useful.","Overall good phone, fast hardware. Mediocre moto software",2023-08-31,4.0,R2LFWQSME0K77O,Heimish Reviews,0.0,"There are a couple design flaws.  First, the speaker is at the bottom of the phone. I tended to rest it on my chest while talking on speaker phone and the speaker was muffled by my shirt.  It also had pointy edges along the part where the speaker opening is at the bottom. It was uncomfortable and bulky to hold while trying to talk or watch videos. The part that was most annoying is that it kept disconnecting from the wifi and without knowing that it had, I ended up using up all of my 5g of data for the month in one day.  Every time I would reconnect to wifi, it would drop again. After a week I just had enough and returned the phone.  With the case I bought it was also too heavy for the magnetic phone holder and would just slide off.  The fingerprint reader was also not easy to access, especially with the case on. Overall, just poorly designed and non ergonomic. One of my worst experiences with a new phone.",Not the best design and wifi kept dropping,2023-08-23,3.0
B0B3PSRHHN,Google Pixel 6a - 5G Android Phone - Unlocked Smartphone with 12 Megapixel Camera and 24-Hour Battery - Charcoal,339.99,4.3,5200,https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0B3PSRHHN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_top?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews,Smartphones,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,4.0,"The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",189.0,R3AAKHR07NTT1B,5.0,More than meets my needs,24.0,R4KHL0ERH66X7,4.0,Solid phone so far and I'm very pleased with it,1.0,R3840XP5ER7LXA,4.0,"For the price, there isn't a better option!",0.0,R1EJ4Q5CVD6V2Z,4.0,"Moving on from Moto G line, great alternative",47.0,R36GQP2LHY1DIG,Thomas Hicks,189.0,"TLDR:  The Pixel 6a is a phone that I can safely recommend to anyone who just wants a device that works, takes decent enough pictures, can get through the day on a single charge, and won't break the bank or double one's monthly mobile bill for the next 2 years.  Tech enthusiasts need not apply.However, as a tech enthusiast who bought one of these as a second phone, I could see myself dailying the Pixel 6a without too many regrets.  I mean, I would feel guilty for coming down hard on it in any particular category simply because it's so darn affordable (particularly when it's on sale).  Plus, there's really nothing else in this price range I can recommend to others with any confidence.  What else can you get for around $300 that is this well-rounded?  In the US?  Not much, though you can get some cheapo Motorola phones for less if you're willing to settle for a weak processor, mediocre cameras, an LCD display (rather than OLED), and a cheaper-feeling, all-plastic build.  You'll also have to settle for weaker software support than the Pixel, which guarantees security updates for another 4 years from now (as well as two more Android OS updates after 13).The nearest competitor is probably the Samsung Galaxy A53 (soon to be A54).  It's also on sale regularly, though I've never seen it as low as the 6a has been.  The Sammy does give you a better display (120Hz AMOLED vs 60Hz OLED) and a bigger battery than the Pixel, but it has a weaker Exynos CPU and worse cameras despite the more impressive specs on paper.  I'd take the Pixel 6a hands down, and that's coming from an 11-year Samsung Galaxy fan.Anyway, onto my detailed personal critique of the Pixel 6a...As I said before, I can't really knock it much considering the price point.  HOWEVER, there are a few sore spots that annoy me and will hopefully be improved upon with the upcoming 7a.The first is the display.  While I appreciate the inclusion of an OLED panel at this price, the 60Hz refresh rate makes my eyes bleed while scrolling.  Harsh?  Yeah, but I've been spoiled by 120Hz displays for years now.  Jumping between this and my S22 Ultra regularly makes the difference even more noticeable.  The 7a is supposed to bump it up to 90Hz, which should greatly improve smoothness.  Refresh rate aside, I also find the display to be a bit on the dim side.  Not that it isn't bright enough in most cases (aside from direct sunlight), but even indoors with minimal lighting the display will adjust to about 50% brightness to maintain adequate visibility.  Meanwhile, my Samsung phones (S22 Ultra and old S21+) are only at 25% brightness in the same environment and still somehow appear to be brighter.  And the colors never seem to pop as much on this phone compared to other OLED-equipped phones I've used.  I suppose that's a key difference between OLED and AMOLED.The second issue is the durability of the materials used to make this phone, mainly the plastic on the back panel.  When brand new, the plastic back does an incredible job of imitating the appearance and feel of glass.  But after minimal use (and even inside of a case, as another reviewer pointed out), this material reveals itself to be ridiculously soft and prone to nicks and scratches.  Mine is covered in little pock marks and micro abrasions despite being in a case the majority of its life.  It's so soft that I swear the little nicks in it are probably from dust particles being pressed into it by popping a case on.  Another ding goes to the dated Gorilla Glass 3 covering the display that's also prone to scratches and sounds really thin and hollow when tapped.  I recommend a screen protector.While steady software updates since the phone's release last July have greatly improved the overall user experience, it still suffers from a few hardware-related headaches.  The modem used in this thing (and its siblings) is infamous for being inefficient, having mediocre reception (though I haven't noticed), and creating massive amounts of heat.  Sadly, no amount of updates can remedy that situation.  It's fine as long as you stick to LTE, in my experience.  Enabling 5G pretty much guarantees that your battery will drain much more quickly and that the back of the phone will stay warm at all times.  On the bright side, you can put it in your back pocket and use it as a ""butt warmer"" on cold days.  If you get a second 6a, you can heat both cheeks evenly.  Don't have heated seats in your car?  Problem solved.  Jokes aside, at least the fingerprint reader and random idle battery drain issues that I experienced early on have been fixed.  It's been months since I've gone to bed with 100% battery only to wake up with 65% left for no reason other than ""just Pixel things"" as a friend of mine with a 6 Pro would call little irritating bugs like those.Now that I've done nothing but blast this poor thing in the previous few paragraphs, let me tell you what I think is great about it.For one, I love the size.  While many out there still think it's too large, I think it's perfect.  After handling a behemoth like the S22 Ultra, this one is a pleasure to grasp even while in a case (of which I recommend the Spigen Rugged Armor, but that's another review).  It's just so light and easy to grip compared to what I'm used to.  It's no Zenfone 9 or iPhone 13 Mini, but it feels downright tiny compared to an S22/23 Ultra or Pixel 6/7 Pro.  Folks with small hands or who simply prefer smaller phones will like this one.  This is the compact option in the realm of budget and mid-range phones, as most inexpensive smartphones have 6.5""+ screens for some reason (I guess they're cheaper to make?).The Pixel software perks are probably my second favorite ""feature"" (though I'm not sure if size can be called a feature...well, maybe but nvm).  Being able to see the title and artist of just about any song playing around me at a glance is something I never knew I wanted.  And while I haven't used them personally, the call waiting assistance and Direct My Call (on-screen choices for automated calls) features sound amazing for simplifying a few of life's little annoyances.  I'm sure there's a lot of great things I'm forgetting to mention but those stand out the most for me.Finally, there's the cameras.  Nothing about the hardware here is fancy or premium, or even new.  In fact, the 6a's main image sensor (Sony IMX363) has been used in the Pixel line as far back as the Pixel 3.  What's propping up these tiny, dated image sensors is Google's amazing camera software and image processing.  While the images produced by this combo won't blow you away, you'll be impressed by just how competent and ""honest"" the results are.  The colors and details are very muted and realistic.  If you're fond of the super-colorful, oversharpened, Ultra HDR photos your typical Samsung phone cranks out, you'll be very disappointed by this phone (and Pixels in general) and should look elsewhere.  I actually prefer the main and ultra-wide cameras on this Pixel to my S22 Ultra for the simple fact that it's better at quick, point and shoot photography.  I can whip the 6a out of my pocket, snap a quick photo, and be 100% confident that resulting picture will be serviceable.  I can't say that about any Samsung that I've ever used.  The main con is the lack of a dedicated telephoto camera.  You can zoom up to 7X with the main camera, but your pictures start looking like watercolor paintings at that level of zoom.  I'd go no higher than 3X and even that is pushing it.Other notes to close out this lengthy, rambling review:Speakers are just okay, and the volume slider has to be cranked fairly high to produce enough sound for normal listening.Battery life is fine, but should honestly be better with a 4410 mAh battery onboard.  In a regular day of use for me, I average about 4-5 hours of screen on time with 5G enabled.I can squeeze out an extra hour or two if I disable 5G and stick to LTE, and the phone runs much cooler on average as an added bonus.  I had a OnePlus 8T with a similarly-sized 4500 mAh battery and snapdragon 865 that could get up to 8 hours of SoT (with 5G disabled, as well), so I feel like the Tensor G1 isn't the most efficient SoC around.Charging is slow, coming from someone who used to daily a OnePlus with 65W Warp Charging.  Still, you can fully charge it in less than 2 hours from nearly-dead.  Could be worse, I guess.  Also, there's no wireless charging on the 6a.As far as performance goes, I can't complain about it in daily use scenarios.  It feels very responsive when opening and navigating my usual apps (Gmail, Twitter, twitch, YouTube, Amazon, etc.).  I'm not a phone gamer, so I can't comment on gaming performance though I imagine that it gets rather hot in a short period of time as that's just what the Tensor does.I've already stated repeatedly that I can recommend this phone to just about anyone because it does just about everything well enough for the average person.  However, the 7a is on the horizon and is expected to bring a 90Hz display, wireless charging, the Tensor G2 from the Pixel 7, and better cameras for a similar RRP.  While it won't be as affordable as the discounted 6a when it launches this summer, I imagine we'll be seeing it in the $300 range by Black Friday.  So you may want to wait for that one unless you need a new phone right now.  Still, the 6a at its current price is an absolute bargain, in my honest opinion.","The best all-around phone at this price point (in the US, at least)",2023-03-22,4.0,R2IRNTEPVHZ7G4,TS,69.0,"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),2022-08-04,3.0

READ THIS!,17.0,RH2T1GVHU3KQ4,5.0,Great phone,3.0,R10E07I4RWKZZN,Kevin Smith,10.0,"I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

However, if you are looking for a portable phone that will fit in a regular pocket, be aware.Set up: tracfone support was useless. They wanted to send me a code to complete the set up, but my old phone was broken so they said they could not, nor did they offer any other options. Fortunately, my adult son switched the sim card from my old phone into the new one and i was able to receive the code on my new phone and complete the process. Without him I would still not have a functional phone.Charging cable: phone did not come with a functional charging cable and to use the one that was sent would have required another purchase. I ended up using the cable from my Fire tablet, which sufficed.Performance: as always there is a learning curve with new technology but so far i am feeling my way along with this phone. Don't expect to receive a user manual because one does not come with this phone. Downloaded one from the internet but it is poorly written and not user friendly.

This annoyed me when scrolling through apps or webpages and seeing text fade through these ""gray zones"" that I couldn't make go away- and this was from a brand new unit that I only had for a few days. Aside from my screen defect, the Pixel 7 was still a great phone.When it comes to the software experience, the clean Android experience is still one of the best that you can get, in addition to also being the first to get new Android updates as they roll out. The color themes that you can choose based on your wallpaper adds another level to customization, and you can even apply these colors to some app icons as well. The software is smooth, and I haven't had any of the software bugs that some others have had. However, what really makes the Pixel experience great are some of the features you can't get on other Android phones such as Google's ""screen call"", ""hold for me"", photo unblur, and magic erase options. My favorite of these is definitely screen call, as when enabled you can have the Pixel automatically answer the call for you and give you a transcript based on the call to let you know whether you should pick up or not in case it is spam. I get a lot of Spam calls personally, so this has saved me the hassle of having to take a lot of unnecessary calls. When it comes to the photo modes, the magic eraser works great when there isn't too much going on, but the photo unblur ability isn't that great. I found that even photos that are only slightly blurred sometimes just get added sharpness from this mode, but without actually unblurring the parts of the photo I needed. My overall favorite part of the default android experience though, is the Google toolbar on the bottom of your homepage. While on the Pixel this bar is not removable, I found it to be the best implementation out of any android phone as it not only allows you to search Google whenever you need, but it also searches your device for apps, videos, and more that might be stored on it. Think of it as an all-in-one search that not only searches the web, but searches your device as well as giving you recommendations based on your recently used apps.Aside from software, the main reason why I have always used Pixel phones is the camera. While the Pixel 7 does have some improvements to the larger sensor, all of the magic still happens on the software processing side. Even photos that may not look like they will be good before pressing the shutter, will look like a professional photo as soon as it is captured and finished processing. This is what the Pixel does best. No matter what phone I use, whether Android-wise or iPhone, the photos produced by the Pixel series are still the best I've ever seen and used. Photos just pop with a well balanced blend of saturation, color, lighting, and sharpness that looks natural to real life. Selfies are the same as well. Despite the front selfie camera being a lower megapixel camera compared to the rear sensor, it still produces great photos and the portrait mode is one of the best on a smartphone. However, while the Pixel 7 captures great photos, it still needs some work on the video side. Videos are an improvement over previous generations, but videos still need a lot of light to look good. When in a well-lit room or outside on a sunny day, the videos are vivid, detailed, clear, and sharp, but as soon as the lights start to dim, the videos will return to a noisy mess. For videos, the iPhone still remains supreme, in my opinion, but the next gen Pixel just might close the gap on the video side.When it comes to battery life, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The Pixel 7 had very mediocre battery life in the first day or two that I had it, with it not lasting more than 4-5 hours on a full charge for me. However, by day 3, the battery life nearly doubled as the adaptive battery feature noticed the apps I was using and optimized itself for a better experience. The phone charges at an average rate and still doesn't charge very fast over wired or wireless chargers, but it is still good enough to fully charge it in a bit over an hour when plugged in directly.When it comes to performance, the Tensor 2 is a powerhouse, but it still doesn't even come close to the newer Snapdragon Flagship chips from the last couple of years. Games can still be a bit stuttery and laggy at times, and you may have to lower some settings for a smooth experience. However, it is still a very capable chip and I would still say it is 2nd best after the Snapdragon.The display is something that is still a mixed bag as although I received a defective unit with my ""gray zones'', the OLED panel used on the non-Pro variants still continues to be much lower quality than the LTPO panels used on the Pro version. While the refresh rate can still go up to 90Hz and is a significant improvement over 60Hz panels, my primary complaint is actually about the fact that the brightness is significantly lower even at max levels and has way more noticeable color shifting when tilting the phone screen to the sides. While it is an OLED panel that still delivers vibrant colors and rich blacks, I just wish it had at least a 1st gen LTPO panel or a higher quality AMOLED than what is being used. While these complaints may seem unwarranted because my display was defective, this was an issue with the Pixel 6 as well when it came to using a lower quality panel compared to the Pro. As someone who has also used the A-series of Pixel phones, the displays on those budget options are nearly identical in quality to the Pixel 7, just with a faster refresh rate on 7 itself.Overall, while the phone itself is still the best value for the money, I was disappointed that my brand new unit had such a big flaw with the display. I've never had this issue with Pixel phones before and it really impacted my opinion of Google's quality for the time being. Aside from that, I still highly recommend this phone to those who want a nearly full flagship phone experience but without spending more than is needed. In terms of photos and software, it is the best there is, but for gaming, productivity, and videos, it still needs some improvements.",Pixel Phones are Still King but Mine Had Flaws,2023-09-10,4.0,R1OH3858AUS7SZ,TJ,108.0,"Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack.

See edit",6.0,R2RHWRA4J23DMT,Briguy Rides,7.0,"Umidigi G1 Max Review: A Budget Phone with Impressive Specs:  I ordered this phone directly from Umidigi and received it very quickly, I have been using the device for almost a month now and wanted to leave a review to share my thoughts along with some benchmark scores from ANTUTU testing.The Umidigi G1 Max is a mid-range smartphone that offers some impressive features for its price. It has a large 6.52-inch IPS display, a 50MP main camera, a 5150mAh battery, and runs on Android 12. It also comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 256GB with a microSD card. The phone is powered by the Unisoc Tiger T610 octa-core processor, which delivers decent performance and efficiency.  All setup and app operations were performed smoothly and without and issues.  I experienced no crashes or other negative performance issues throughout my time using this device.ProsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a sleek and stylish design, with a right-angle frame and a glossy back. It comes in two colors: Galaxy Blue and Starry Black. I received the Galaxy Blue and found this finish to be really quality and not a fingerprint magnet.  Also Super Bonus, the device was delivered with a case which is awesome!The phone has a large and immersive display, with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a waterdrop notch. The screen has a resolution of 720 x 1600 pixels, which is adequate for watching videos and browsing the web.The phone has a powerful 50MP main camera, which can capture detailed and vivid photos in various scenarios. It also has a 2MP depth camera for portrait mode, and an 8MP selfie camera. The phone supports night mode, HDR, panorama, and 1080p video recording. I had no issues watching videos or editing photos all were done with speed and ease.The phone has a massive 5150mAh battery, which can last for more than a day of moderate use. It also supports fast charging with a 10W charger included in the box. - I never had an issue with the battery running out before a full day of use which I cannot say the same for other devices I have used lately.The phone runs on Android 12, which offers enhanced privacy features, dynamic personalization, and faster app startup. The phone also has minimal bloatware and offers a smooth user experience.The phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and face unlock, which are fast and convenient to use. It also has other sensors such as accelerometer, proximity, and compass.The phone supports global bands, dual SIM, dual standby, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS, and USB Type-C. It does not have NFC though.ConsThe Umidigi G1 Max has a low screen resolution compared to other phones in its price range. It also has thick bezels around the display, which reduce the screen-to-body ratio.The phone does not have a dedicated microSD slot, but uses a hybrid SIM slot instead. This means that users have to choose between dual SIM or extra storage.The phone does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, which may disappoint some users who prefer wired headphones. It also does not have stereo speakers or Dolby Atmos support.ConclusionThe Umidigi G1 Max is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers some impressive specs for its price. It has a large display, a powerful camera, a huge battery, and Android 12. It also has ample RAM and storage space, and supports global bands. All around a great device that checks in much higher performance wise than the low price tag would otherwise indicate!!",Fantastic Budget Option Android That Punches Above It's Weight Class With Features,2023-05-25,5.0,R3KDM6LHGWP8EC,Ron Novak,6.0,"See edits belowI bought the G 1 Max to replace another old phone. Had already bought an UMIDGI Bison 2 Pro, WHICH WORKS WITH VERIZON. I checked the specs on the G 1 Max, looked the same as the Bison. When I got it, I checked out the G 1 AND IT DOESN'T WORK (voice and text) WITH VERIZON..... Well, why? After an hour talking to a Verizon Tech Person, I think I know. The write-up says it doesn't work with CDMA providers like Verizon, but Verizon has discontinued CDMA. So that is meaningless. They use 4 G LTE now... This phone uses 4 G LTE, so it must work.... NOT! Verizon uses 4 G LTE with VOLTE, Voice Over LTE..... So to work with Verizon the device has to have VOLTE.. The Bison 2 Pro has it (just try to find it in the specs!), and it's good with Verizon, the G 1 Max doesn't and it doesn't work....... Connects, but no texts or voice.....This is too bad, since the G 1Max is a really nice phone. I would like to find one like it that works with Verizon. And it helps that it's half the price of the Bison 2 Pro. I'm on my second Bison, the screen on the first went black and white and started flashing on and off.... We'll see how the second holds up.Guess I'll have to do more research on the pathetic UMIDGI website to find all their 4 G, VOLTE devices....... Happy hunting!EDIT 1Looking at the glitzy UMIDIGI website dazzles the eye but doesn’t tell you much, like all sales pitches. HOWEVER, looking at the specs for a similar device to the G1 MAX, the C1 MAX, (they are lumped together) it look as if the C1 does support VOLTE. That said, the specs of the two devices are lumped together, but the G1 does not have VOLTE. So, I am going to order the C1 MAX and see if it actually works on Verizon. I commented to the techs at UMIDIGI that they ought to segregate the devices by generation and have a category for VOLTE since it seems to be the deciding factor in whether a device works with Verizon. Don’t hold your breath! Stay tuned for the next edit!Edit 2Neither the C1 nor the G1 is likely to work with Verizon. With a lot of research and an hour with a Verizon “technician”, I have come to the conclusion that in order for a cellphone to work with Verizon, two things are necessary; First, the phone has to use VOLTE, and Second, it has to use bands 2, 4, AND 13! (This is for 4G only) Neither the C1 nor the G1 has band 13, and they probably won’t work. I checked the specs of 11 Umidgi phones and bought an A11 to check this hypothesis out. It has both VOLTE and bands 2, 4, and 13. AND IT WORKS FINE WITH VERIZON!!!!! And it is priced at ~$109!!!!!! So check the specs and don’t get stuck……..Edit 3I have upgraded my rating to 3 stars since I think that the G1 Max is a fine phone, it just doesn't work with Verizon....... The experience I had with it otherwise (GPS, cruising the internet, etc) was a good one. Like I indicated, I wish the phone worked with Verizon! The build quality is good and it is a bargain!","DOES NOT WORK WITH VERIZON, PERIOD!!!!!! See edit",2023-03-02,3.0

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

READ THIS!,17.0,RH2T1GVHU3KQ4,5.0,Great phone,3.0,R10E07I4RWKZZN,Kevin Smith,10.0,"I have been waiting for Umidigi to release an unlocked phone with Global 5g bands that I could use on the Verizon network, and this one finally seemed to fit the bill. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from such an inexpensive phone, but I own two Umidigi smartwatches and have gifted numerous more over the years and they have all been excellent so I thought I'd give it a shot. It took a few days to arrive, and upon opening the package I have to say that I was impressed - It was very professionally packaged, with clear, bright imagery and text. Inside the package is the phone with a screen protector and clear TPU case included and already installed, a larger-than-average wall wart (power adapter), and what appears to be an above-average quality USB-C charging cable, as well as a clear, concise instruction manual in multiple languages. The phone was also already charged to 96% so it was ready to use right out of the box. Inside the package there is also a SIM Removal Tool that is used to eject the SIM tray so you can install the SIM card from your cellphone provider. This phone has Dual SIM capability so you can have two separate SIM cards installed and operational at the same time if needed, in case you travel to multiple countries and need that feature. You can alternatively install a Micro SD card up to 512GB in the second SIM slot to increase the storage capacity of the already very reasonable 256GB internal capacity. After taking the phone out of the box I removed the SIM Tray using the removal tool, installed the SIM from my Verizon Samsung Galaxy S21 and powered the phone on. It was a little slow to boot up and get to the Setup screen but was quick and easy to move through the standard Android setup. Once the initial settings were completed the phone asked if I wanted to transfer apps and data from another phone or device, and I opted to copy everything from my S21 by plugging in a USB-C to USB-C cable, which the Umidigi phone walks you through and makes very easy. It may take a while (mine took about 18 minutes due to the number of apps, data, contacts, etc.) so be patient. After it was finished I restarted the phone and let it complete the rest of the software setup as is normal. Although the phone showed that it was connected to the Verizon 5G network I was initially unable to make or receive phone calls or send or receive texts, but I was able to go to webpages and connect to the google play store, etc... I ended up having to reset the network from within the settings menu, and after that calls and texts started working as they should. When loading a site with heavy data the phone will load the page quickly and accurately but may hesitate slightly while scrolling the pages, but overall it is hardly noticeable and nothing to complain about really. The overall speed and consistency of the phone are quite impressive, and on par with phones priced 4-8 times what this one costs. The size, clarity of the screen, and features rival MANY of the more expensive phones on the market today, and other than the lack of wireless charging, IP68 waterproofing, and having a slightly less capable camera system (and that's not saying this one is not good, as it takes great pictures and has some nice features), this phone impresses me just as much as many of those ""market leaders"".Next, I connected my Galaxy Gear S3 Frontier smartwatch, and a pair of headphones to the phone via Bluetooth to test the compatibility out, and they both paired quickly and easily and work well. I did have a minor issue with my Gear S3 smartwatch seeming to disconnect from the phone after about 10 minutes, so I restarted the phone and reconnected it (via the Galaxy Wear app), and it disconnected from the app again just a few minutes later, but wasn't actually disconnected from the phone because I received a call that came through to the watch just fine, and also received text notifications on the watch just fine, so I think that there is an issue with the Galaxy Wear app itself after it was ""transferred"" from my S21 to the Umidigi. I plan to uninstall the app and reinstall it later to see if that corrects the issue, but it's not that important to me right now. The headphones remained paired and operate as expected and have not lost connectivity so I am sure it is not an issue with the Bluetooth in the phone itself. I also connected the phone to my car via Bluetooth and everything works perfectly in there as well, I made and received a couple of phone calls, used hands-free voice to text to tell the car to call someone, and received text messages without any issues.For $239 you really can't go wrong with this phone, and if you can catch it when it has a $20 or $30 coupon, you're getting an absolute bargain! I had just missed out on a $30 coupon, but waited a couple of days and saw a $20 coupon pop up so I quickly took advantage of it before it went away. If you're looking for a solid performer with great features without breaking the bank, this is an excellent option. If you're buying your first smartphone for a teenager or even for yourself and you aren't a ""fanboy/girl"" of Samsung or Apple, you will be more than happy with everything this phone has to offer (it does virtually everything the $800-1500 phone does, without the price tag and stress about breaking it or losing it). I doubt I'll buy another new $1000 phone again after this, especially if Umidigi ups their game and adds wireless charging, which is about the only feature I miss on this phone compared to my S21, and maybe IP68 waterproofing since I do have a tendency to end up in the water with my phones from time to time.I have been using the phone for 3 days now, in place of my S21, for calls, texts, video, music, controlling my smart-home devices, viewing and controlling security cameras in and around my home, and as a remote control for three separate entertainment systems in my living room, bedroom, and outside under my Gazebo, and it has been functioning very well for everything in my day-to-day life. It currently has 15% battery life remaining, and I have not plugged it in to charge at all since unboxing it (remember earlier when I said it arrived already charged to 96%?). I will admit I am not a major consumer of video or music, nor do I talk for extended periods, on the phone, so my battery consumption is typically lower than average, but the battery life on this phone has been really impressive so far, especially considering I usually have to charge my S21 every night and sometimes more frequently. It is, of course, NEW, so we'll see how well it holds up after a year of hard use.I will most likely give this phone to my 17-year-old to replace a well-worn Galaxy S8, and let it be abused far beyond what I am capable of, and will update my review in the future if anything changes.The first few included photos are of the packaging, the phone and included accessories as I unpacked it, a closeup of the phone with the case and screen protector (and a second removable layer in place), another photo of the package taken WITH the F3 Pro itself, and a photo of an Umidigi smartwatch taken with the F3 Pro.",An exceptional budget phone on par with bigger brands,2023-07-20,5.0,R3KY8STDM8WL9G,Jason,17.0,"First, I want to say I've only had a couple of days with this phone. However, with only a couple of days, this is my experience and what I have learned. I have Verizon. A normal 5G plan. Regardless what the posting says, this phone DOES WORK on Verizon networks. There is, however, a disclaimer here with all of my testing. I have a 5G SIM card for Verizon. When inserted, it does immediately pick up Verizon signals. All APN's check out fine and the same as my other Verizon Branded phones. Texts, multimedia pictures, and 5G data ALL WORK without issues. Calling, however, does NOT! I have tried changing settings and APN values with no resolve. I went as far as to go to an actual Verizon store (never do that lol) to get help setting it up. Verizon will try to claim it isn't compatible when I can say first hand it absolutely is! Now, here is the strange thing... I used another 4gLTE SIM card and EVERYTHING WORKED PERFECTLY! VoLTE lit up on the bars and I was also getting 5G speeds/signals as well. (For those whom aren't aware, there is essentially no difference in a 4gLTE and 5G SIM card. They both run on both bands. VoLTE is HD Calling which is necessary for Verizon networks now a days. But it does seem that this phone does not read the HD Calling (VoLTE) features on 5G cards. In my case, I was not able to get a new 4gLTE SIM card through Verizon as they only offer 5G SIM cards now. I do have my old 4gLTE SIM card and tried to have it activated but they said ""I would be going backwards and lose my current plan"". Again, there essentially is no difference in the cards. This is just Verizon being more of a pain in the a$$ than needed. I was using my 4gLTE SIM card on my current plan and using it with a 5G phone. No changes. I only changed to a 5G SIM card because I was looking to ""upgrade"" to a new SIM. My mistake clearly.So for those who want this phone on Verizon, YES it is absolutely possible! Just be sure you have a 4gLTE SIM card and everything works perfect. If you have a 5G SIM, everything works EXCEPT calling!As for the phone itself, again I only had a couple of days with it but I did test out many of its features. It was super fast. Zero lag or hangups. I did load it with all of my heavy usage apps and played with it quite a bit before I realized the calling wasn't working. I was using data and texting so I assumed everything was great. Until I tried making a call of course. Camera was pretty good with a beautiful clear picture. What I loved most about this phone was the extra custom programmable button on the side! I seriously wish other phone manufacturers would follow this lead. From quick launching an app to something as simple as enabling the flashlight without having to turn the phone on and finding the icon in the status bar. Amazing feature to have! No bloatware. Fit and feel were, in my opinion, what I would expect on a phone. It is a plastic case but overall weight and feel were great! Screen clarity was also very pleasant.All in all, I would absolutely recommend this phone given you're able to use it with your 4gLTE SIM card. You will absolutely still get your 5G speeds and such. Good luck!Update: I was contacted by a representative from Umidigi. She seemed to be extremely polite and fully admitted on their part of perhaps not having the correct radio bands built into the phone. Hopefully a future OTA Update can fix the issue. However, as with many sellers on here putting an image for more sales seems to be more important. I was offered ""full refund while keeping the device"" if I were to remove my real world review. First of all, the device was already returned so I wasn't getting anything ""free"". Secondly, I don't feel my review on this phone was horrible. I praised the phone for what it is. But I also feel it is just as important for others to be aware if they're also on the Verizon network. If you use other networks I'm sure it'll be perfect. Again, the phone and the built-in specs are amazing in my opinion. I just wish it would have worked on Verizon's VoLTE on a 5G SIM. Best of luck to this company and I'll look into them again in the future. As for now, I have went the Xiaomi Poco X5 Pro 5G and this phone is just absolutely incredible for its price point! And yes, everything works as it should. I'll have a review on that soon!",For those on Verizon network... READ THIS!,2023-08-14,1.0

The processor is a helio P23 which is a low end processor. I was able to play pubg at default setting on good framerate. There was some lag at the beginning but it smooth out a few minutes into the game. There were some stuttering when scrolling through the phone. It can be annoying if you use a high end phone and switch to this phone. I have used a p23 processor phone before and it seemed much smoother than this phone. I think the OS has not have time to optimized itself. A few more days of use and it probably not as noticable.The touch screen is not as responsive. It is only noticable when playing games where you are trying to use mutiple input at once only to notice your character not doing anything. I'm not sure if it's the tpu screen protector that come with this phone is not as touch sensitive or it's the phone itself not allowing multiple touch input especially near the center of the phone.This phone have 4 camera. Two at 16 MP and two at 5MP. The images looks very bright and clear on the phone but captured images does not look as bright. Comparing the images to my high end phone, it's almost as good but on low light, the images is grainier than the high end phone. I have used other umidigi phone and their camera have problems focusing the image when the phone is close to the object. Umidigi seem to have fixed that problem on this phone. The camera focused on the image very fast even when the phone is very close to the object. It's almost as fast as focusing on the image as my high end phone.I have not used the phone enough to actually know how decent the battery is. I was setting up this phone and noticed that the battery drain very fast. It usually takes a while for os to optimize it's battery. I did noticed that some phone go through battery very fast when going through the setting so it's not just this phone. The phone took almost 2 hours to charge from 7%-97%.The phone comes with stock android 10. The app drawer has been removed on this os version. It's very annoying because you have apps all over your screen that you have to organized yourself.Another cons of this phone is the placement of the power button. It's way too low for one hand use. It should be where the ""volume - "" button is. I accidentally press the volume button quite often when trying to press the power button. It will need some getting used to for some people.When using this phone, it feel very basic. There are no features that stand out at all except maybe for the camera which is probably the phone main selling point. This phone is like the jack of all trade of low end phone.In the description, it stated that the 128gb version can be use on cdma network. I do not use cdma network, but it does work on my tmobile network. I can make and receive calls. I get about 500mbs-900mbs download speed when downloading apps.The specs that this phone comes with, would have cost $50 more on other phone. Umidigi made budget phones with good specs at a much lower price than other manufacturer but they are known not to update security patch of the phone. This can be a major reason why some people choose other phone over others.If you need a phone that can do a bit of everything, then this phone is decent for you. If security is a concern for you, then this phone might not be for you.Update:Tested the phone playing games, battery lasted about 4-5 hours. If you are using the phone mainly for surfing the web or watching youtube, it probably last a little longer. The games and os is no longer as laggy. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. It is a huge improvement over previous model fingerprint reader because it recognized my finger print even when it's wet. It's a good phone for the price.",Decent Budget Phone,2020-07-31,5.0,R3K1KEMULQPQED,DonValdino,7.0,"This review is for the Umidigi F3 pictured. So I had this phone for a while now. The only reason I decided to buy a new phone was because my old phone, LG V40 ThinQ, would not charge. The prongs in the charging port got screwed up. So I went ahead and bought this phone just for the time being, I just needed a phone. Ok, now let's get right to it. Battery life I find to be average at best, I'm not a heavy phone user either. Supposed to have a 5150mah battery, well my LG has a 3200mah and they last the same, weird. Oh, and after buying this phone i found out about a nest feature my LG has, wireless charging 😑 so yes, it can charge now 🤦🏽‍♂️. Alright so back to the Umidigi, camera, again, no wow factor here either, the image of the Umidigi box was taken with the phone, so that should give you and idea. This I will say, the macro camera is in fact really good, but the main ""Sony"" camera and the other are average at best. Sound, average but the functions are annoying, let me explain. So if you are on a call and switch over to loudspeaker, if the volume is not all the way up, the call goes in and out, like you'll hear the voice go up and down in volume, it stays consistent only if the volume is at max and stays there. Brightness feature, is good, but it stays rather bright in the dark, like it does not know to turn brightness all the way down, you have to set it to manual and lower it yourself. Storage is amazing, 128gb of rom is great. 8gb of ram I don't believe, my LG has 6gb of ram and it's waaayyyy smoother than this phone that supposed to have 8gb of ram. When playing CODm it glitches, not for long periods of time, maybe a second, but it does glitch, just freezes on you and you get all the lines going across the screen. Connectivity, works flawlessly on my T-Mobile, no issues there, calls connect with ease, and like I mentioned before, so as long as the volume is at max, you can hear just fine. Social media, no issues there, internet browsing no issues there either. YouTube, no issues there, streaming music no issues there al well as streaming movies, no issues there either. Now to sum it all up, if you are like I was, in need of a phone asap for the time being, then this phone will be just fine. If you are looking for a budget phone with flagship phone performance, you are looking in the wrong place. This phone came out in 2022, my LG came out in 2018. This phone was $160 my LG $700 when it just came out in 2018. Although my Umidigi is recent, you cannot compare these two phones. The price speaks for itself. The LG to date still performs as a $700 dollar phone. So when you look at it from that point of view, bang for the buck, the Umidigi F3 performs as a $160 phone, don't expect anything more. All the features are sales pitch, that's why you buy the phone, you see the specs then see the price and go wow! And you buy it, then a few months go by, and the phone just sits there because it's not as great as you expected. At best, this phone is a temporary phone, something to hold you down until you can get something better. Overall i give this phone 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Just think of the price,2023-04-02,3.0

It's got a surprisingly good screen. The 90hz setting makes it pretty smooth and the colors and brightness are decent. It fades pretty fast at angles, but I'm not going to get picky about that for $150 (it was on sale).As far as performance, it's really good. Coming from a flagship android phone to this, I notice a hiccup or stutter here and there, but it's 80% of the way there for a quarter of the price. The camera is pretty good too, not flagship quality, but far from a potato.

As a long time user of Samsung and Pixel phones on the Android side of things, this is honestly a better phone in almost every way possible- aside from that camera.The unit I received was brand new as described, and it was in perfect working condition. I was able to easily add my SIM card to it and transfer my Google Fi number to this phone in just a few minutes. (Note, this phone does not support eSIM, so you will need a physical SIM card to set it up.) The setup was also very easy and simple to do and has the same data and app transfer option as on other android devices.Once set up, it was still on Android 12 by default, but I did have a large series of updates that took about an hour to fully get it up to the latest release of Android 13. The phone had approximately 7 updates in this time frame.Software:Once fully updated, OxygenOS was a breath of fresh air. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I was using a version of Android that was more customizable than ever as well as giving the default Android-like experience a whole new form. OxygenOS was cleaner and more modern than any other Android skin I've seen, with a translucent app and notification drawer, subtle icon animations when expanding the quick settings, and so much more. Even the built-in clock has a red color for the ""1"" digits as a subtle nod to OnePlus itself. While the entire skin feels smoother than any Android experience I have ever had, it is also the most customizable. You can change the icons to a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, and colors and the same goes for the software color themes, home page screen transitions, the always on display, and even the battery icon style itself. It's an endlessly adjustable software to reflect the style you like the most and I really, really like that. When it comes to ringtones it even has a much higher amount of ringtones I've ever seen preloaded on a phone, and the haptics are out of this world as each ringtone has haptics that respond identically to the tune that is playing. It's just that great and I haven't even mentioned the side quick app drawer or the shelf features. Also, despite being a physical switch, the phone also has a three-way slider above the power button that can instantly switch your phone between Ring, Haptic, and Silent modes as well as muting your audio automatically. It's similar to the silent mode switch on an iPhone but better, in my opinion.Performance:When it comes to performance I was very impressed. Despite the fact that I got the 8GB of RAM model, the phone was snappy and blazing fast. Apps launched in no time and apps scrolled with perfect butter-y action with that 120Hz display. My games were lag free in all that I tried and I am just overall very pleased with the performance.Display:In this phone is an LTPO gen 2 OLED panel that is one of the best I've seen aside from a Samsung phone. Not only is it able to automatically adjust its frame rate to conserve battery life, but it does it in a way that you wouldn't otherwise notice. There is no hitching or stuttering or weird glitches from the display shifting its frame rate and it is just a flawless experience. Not only that, the display is incredibly vivid, detailed, and bright and I didn't notice any color shifting like on some lower quality OLED panels. The HDR looks great, and the screen is super immersive. You will not be disappointed when playing games or watching content as it is one of the best displays I have seen. However, I am not the biggest fan of the curved edges as I prefer a flat display but the edges of the display are not too troublesome or as curved as some others.Battery Life:At first I was slightly worried that the battery wasn't going to be good as despite its exceptionally fast charging speeds, my phone was depleting charge extremely fast the first few days that I had it. In the days since, the battery has held up much better with somedays giving me as much as triple the screen on time compared to when I first got it. I assume that this is from the adaptive battery functionality finally optimizing itself based on how I use my phone and what apps I run, but it is something to take note of as you must give the phone a few days to get this kind of battery life. Presently, I am able to use it all day with about 30% charge left around bedtime. Now, the most standout feature about this phone is its charging capabilities. From a near 0 charge, this phone can almost completely get back to 100% in just 30 minutes which is crazy to me as I am used to phones taking anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours to fully charge. So, if you just need a quick charge, just plug this in for a few minutes and you'll get a couple hours of screen time. It's that fast. If you prefer to charge wirelessly, it will also support insanely fast wireless charge speeds, but you have to make sure your wireless charger is capable of putting out the necessary wattage.Speakers:The speakers on this phone are very good. While they don't get as loud as I would like, they do deliver fuller and more natural sounding audio compared to other phones I have used. Voices sound crisp and clear, and music sounds detailed and rich. The only disappointment I have with the speaker aside from the volume level is that the bass is not very noticeable, but this isn't that much of an issue to me. The speakers deliver what I would describe as a mostly ""flat"" or otherwise balanced sound EQ.Build Quality:This is also without a doubt one of the most comfortable phones I have ever used. Even though I usually put a case on all of my devices, this is probably the only one I would consider using without one. The back of the phone has this unusual but incredibly well done powdered granite-like feel as the frosted matte finish is soft and soothing against the hands. It doesn’t look or feel like glass at all as it feels more like a soft stone, and the best part is this finish doesn’t leave fingerprints of any kind which means you don’t need to constantly wipe it down. It also gives it a slight amount of grip to hold as it isn’t slippery. Despite not being a fan of curved edges, the design of the phone is not too narrow or too wide which allows it to fit almost perfectly in my hands as if it was naturally designed for them. The phone is also very light weight despite all that is packed inside of it, and I just really think the design, feel and weight of the phone is one of the best I have ever used.Camera:We are finally at the weakest part of the entire phone. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the cameras on this phone just can't quite live up to the photos taken on other Android phones such as the Pixel series or Galaxy Ultra phones. It gets even worse when you compare the selfie cameras as the photos taken by this phone are extremely soft and lack detail. While the rear camera can still take some fairly good photos, it is more of a ""luck of the draw"" as sometimes it will capture a good photo and other times it will not. Videos are even worse. While most android phones have never really been that good when it comes to video, there is something noticeably wrong with the videos I record with this phone. It's like all the saturation got turned up to a 1000 as the colors are way over done compared to real life in addition to all the shadow details being crushed with nothing but pure black. It's still usable to make a quick post, but I would not recommend using it to record videos for content creation. Overall, it is not the worst camera by any means as it is still fairly good, but it just doesn't live up to my expectations.Overall, this is an excellent phone that when on sale, I would say is better than almost anything else aside from the camera. At the current sub-500 cost, the performance, battery life, display quality, and software experience is unrivaled. The only thing that hurts the value in my opinion is the camera, but it excels in almost every other category. I highly recommend it.",Better than Almost Every Flagship Phone,2023-09-10,4.0,R2QXDXGCOFG39C,three_legs,2.0,"First off I like this camera. 30x is actually amazing.However, without access to MSM and edl firehose etc I am kinda disappointed.Basically if you brick your device doing any development there are two options open it up to do a hardware jumper bypass or send it back to OnePlus. The new MSM tool uses a unique key pair for each phone that links to oopos servers for the private key. So you need oopo credentials. While I'm sure someone will find a way eventually I'm not able to provide much in the way of research with my current situation. Their merger with oopo has been a failure there's things that I just can't tolerate with oos like the relatively weak encryption and security standards. Which are admittably Android standard. I apologize to Amazon but I'll have to send this one back I'll probably be buying an even older OnePlus.",Read if you're a developer.,2023-06-17,3.0

Packaging is nice, comes with a brief, clearly written user manual which I used right away to see how to change the sound options. I use a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G, and I took these buds out of the package, directly out of the case and put them right in. The default female voice told me they were powered on right away, sounding in both ears, in the order i put them in. Opened bluetooth options on my phone and they were already listed as ""Raycon Everyday Buds."" I touched the name and they connected right off without any issue whatsoever. Hit play on my music, and I love the sound. I just opened them today, so I'm waiting to see how these endure before giving full stars.The button in each bud is a physical push button, a bubble that clicks. I like it because the sweaty strap from my bike helmet won't press it inadvertently like my old buds that just had ""touch control."" You can't see the bud when you reach up to touch it, so it's always a game of fumbling with where to touch it and how many ""touches"" would register. Especially when on the mountain bike, that frustrated me, but maybe you like it (wierdo)...Sound quality:I love all three modes. ""Balanced, Bass and Pure"" they all sound good while bringing in their individual strengths. For piano pieces, like Paul Cardall or Ludivico Eiunadi, Pure Sound is precise. For Van Halen, Nightwish, and Godsmack, Balanced sound and Bass modes are excellent. It's all subjective anyway, but I can hear the details and fairly crisp sounds.Awareness Mode:This is my first time trying buds that have a mode where they claim to allow you to hear ambient noise around you while still enjoying the music. Raycon calls it ""Awareness Mode"". It works, but not as i had hoped. In my mind, I had anticipated being able to speak while listening to my music and hear my voice and others' clearly through the electronic mic instead of through jawbone vibrations like when you plug your ears with your fingers and speak. These buds can do that, but you can only hear it faintly, and I find myself wishing I could turn up that volume. But if I turn it up, only the music gets louder and the ambient sounds are left behind as the music grows in volume. The ambient sound volume is constant, and only works well if I turn the music off. Which is a disapponting feature because then what's the point? Without the music, I might as well remove the buds right? All buds claim to have powerful noise canceling, but what I'm hoping for is exactly the opposite, I want to hear my music and all the ambient sounds while biking, running, and working at my computer. It should be like hearing the world around me but with cool music that nobody else can hear. Why isn't this an option? Maybe I'm the wierdo.The fit is okay... It comes with multiple gel sizes. The default sizes were a bit tight, so I downsized them by one, and they are comfortable for about 15 minutes then I have to push them in again. Not quite settled on which size of gel I should be using. This shouldn't be that difficult but...UPDATE: 8/24/22I've had them for over a month now. Still working as they did they day I opened them.*The container charges in just a couple hours*The longest I have had these in is about 5 hours, my ears became fatigued from the fit before the battery ran out while I was backpacking. The buds charged up and container still had more than 50%*PHONE CALLS: I haven't had problems hearing clear audio from the phone calls. When I ask the other caller how I sound they have told me I'm difficult to hear well. If i turn off Bluetooth and speak directly into the phone they report my sound as being much better. Not impressed with the microphone quality. But I have had no problems at all hearing the other caller clearly.*I have not yet had any connection problems with my phone*I still am disappointed with the Awareness Mode.  It's very underwhelming compared to my daughter's Jabra Elite Active 75 earbuds with the same feature. Those are significantly better in this regard.*I wear these while mountain biking, they stay in fine, but I don't bomb down the mountain either.*I really wish I had the ability to adjust the equalizer settings but it's fixed in stone. The app is a complete joke, no functionality at all. No my friend, if you want to adjust the equalizer, these are not for you. I do wish I could adjust the bass to be more pronounced, and the highs to be a bit sharper.12/2/2022 UPDATE: over 1 year ownership..I still have these and they still work as described above, they hold charge forever. But at this point I'm ready for a different pair just because of the phone call quality and the weak awareness mode. I've also found that I can't remember how to use all the features because the push button functions aren't very intuitive, and no app to use for adjustments. I can answer a phone call, one push in either ear, but the quality is still reported as ""difficult to hear.""

As they say, ""You get what you pay for,"" and this phone perfectly embodies that sentiment. If you're looking for a budget-friendly device that covers the basics, the A03 might be an option to consider. However, be prepared to deal with its frustratingly sluggish performance.Pros:✅ Budget-Friendly: One of the most appealing aspects of the Samsung A03 is undoubtedly its price. It's a wallet-friendly option for those who need a smartphone but don't want to break the bank.✅ Decent Display: The display is adequate for everyday tasks such as checking emails, browsing social media, and watching videos. The colors are decent, and the screen size is comfortable.Cons:❌ Sluggish Performance: The most significant drawback of the A03 is its painfully slow performance. Apps take forever to open, switching between tasks is a test of patience, and even simple actions like typing can lead to frustrating delays. This sluggishness significantly hampers the overall user experience.❌ Limited Storage: The internal storage on the A03 is quite limited, leaving you with minimal space for apps, photos, and other files. You'll likely find yourself constantly juggling storage to make room for new content.❌ Mediocre Camera: While I didn't expect flagship-level camera quality from a budget phone, the A03's camera still falls short. Photos lack detail and tend to look washed out, especially in low-light conditions.❌ Outdated Software: The A03 comes with an older version of Samsung's software, and updates are infrequent. This not only means missing out on the latest features but also leaves you vulnerable to security risks.Overall Impression:The Samsung A03 is a prime example of the trade-off between price and performance. If you're on a tight budget and need a device for the bare minimum tasks like calls, texts, and occasional browsing, the A03 might serve its purpose. However, if you're looking for a smoother experience, even for basic tasks, I'd recommend saving up a bit more for a more capable phone. The sluggishness and limited features of the A03 can quickly become frustrating, overshadowing its affordable price point. Consider your priorities carefully before making a decision.",Affordable but Slow,2023-08-09,3.0

The phone also comes with other nice features like night vision camera, fm radio, high power flash light, etc, which are all nice pluses, but won't make me so excited about. However in my opinion, the only regret about the phone is that it didn't comes with a 3.5mm audio jack, which are normally found on other doogee phones like s61 or s51.

Unfortunately, they won't update to OxygenOS 13, since it originally shipped under 11.  So I guess my one update was done in the box.  Settings menus are kind of a mess.

I like to cover my camera with tape when I'm not using it, and it's more difficult to do that when the camera is inside the screen - as in, the screen is displaying stuff around the camera lens.  I'd prefer a camera that's under the screen, and but is not displaying anything above it, so it's easier to tape up.Review:I've always avoided OnePlus, because despite their motto of ""Never Settle"", their major lineup has always seemed exactly like settling to me - no microSD slot, nor 3.5mm headphone jack, nor NFC, and other missing basic features, even before the industry sadly started killing some those features off in most phones.  Unfortunately, it's been harder to find phones that meet some of my basic criteria that I just mentioned.  So while I was looking for a new phone, I was pretty interested in trying a OnePlus phone that finally had those things.  For the most part, the phone works great. Rooting was easy enough. The phone is still getting security updates. Calls are clear.  Camera quality is not great, but not terrible. The phone does run a little slow at times, but is pretty responsive for the most part.  HOWEVER, there's a major problem, in my opinion, with the software.  It is the sole reason for me knocking 2 of the stars off. The phone's task killer is stupidly aggressive.  If you don't know, this is the thing on Android that usually manages what apps you have running on your phone, in the foreground and in the background. Whatever app you're looking at & using, is likely in the foreground.  Whatever apps are running, but you're not actively using, such as a music or video player, is likely in the background.  On this phone, that thing is so aggressive, that I can seldom have one app running in the background, let alone more than that.  Trying to play music from a music player, while trying to browse the internet?  Expect your music player in the background to get slaughtered within a few minutes, because the phone's task killer won't allow it.  Switching between 2-3 apps while multi-tasking?  1 or 2 of them will likely get killed, probably resetting whatever you were doing in them.  As you might guess from my comment about rooting, I'm a power user.  I know my way around Android probably way better than the average user.  Before I even rooted, I was suffering from this issue.  I've tried setting every option in the phone that I could find, to not kill certain apps in the background.  Yet none of them seem to have any effect on disabling this ""feature"".  There are root-only solutions for this type of issue, but they also don't fix the problem on this phone. From hours of researching online, I'm not the only one with this complaint.  It seems like whatever is causing this aggressive task killer behavior, is ingrained deep in OnePlus's badly designed operating system. From what I've read, this aggressive task killing behavior is also oddly normal for OnePlus's operating systems on most of their phones, which I wish I would've known before buying this phone.  Also, the music player is just one example.  There are various other apps that I like to setup to run in the background and do certain things.  And they keep closing & failing, because of the overly aggressive task killer.  I think maybe it's OnePlus's way of hiding the phone's slow performance, by not allowing anything in the background to slow it down.  It is such a massive shame, because this one major issue, absolutely ruins the phone for me.  $300 for a phone with an issue like this, is an absurd price. I think $150 is more reasonable, until this issue is fixed.  I've used plenty of $100 phones, that work better, without the need to kill apps so aggressively. Some of the customizability options in the OnePlus system's settings are also more limited than the average Android phone that I've used, so the software just seems to be poorly designed in general.I really want to support companies that continue producing phones with micro SD cards, 3.5mm headphone jacks, easy rootability, heck, removable batteries, if we could get those back.  Those features are becoming harder & harder to find, and I consider them essential, far more than some gimmick on other phones, like a 100MP camera, or having 4 camera lens. But unfortunately, despite the decent hardware on the OnePlus Nord, the software still very much feels like settling.","Decent hardware, horrible software",2023-05-28,2.0

I then signed up for a TracFone plan. I purchased the unlimited talk and text, and 2 GB plan. The reason I went with TracFone is because they have rollover minutes. My typical use of data is 1 GB per month. Therefore I thought I would be rolling over 1 GB each month. I just paid for my February plan on the 28th, so I should have 2 GB and whatever's left for rollover. I currently have .69 rollover GB  and zero new GB. At the bare minimum, I should have 2 GB of new data. And maybe 4 GB of rollover.I received a message that my phone had been unlocked, or was available to be unlocked, after 60 days of having my phone. I don't know if it's unlocked or not. I'm ready to move my phone to a different plan so I can get what I pay for, but the customer service is atrocious for TracFone.I first tried chatting online. I was number 86 in the queue, I waited. The person answered my question that I had .69 GB of data. I asked another question, and he was gone.So I called customer service and waited 25 minutes, the girl came on the phone and I asked her if she could first tell me when did I start my service with tracfone. She informed me she could not give me that information. I was confused! I asked her why she can't she said it's a policy. I said how then am I supposed to know if I have the right amount of rollover minutes. And she said it's a policy I can't tell you. I said well I have another question... And she cut me off.The phone rang, and it rang two rings I couldn't answer it quick enough and it was dead. My guess was that was them calling me back.I kept trying to call them back but it would get answered and then cut off, right away. No human no automated voice. I waited 40 minutes, and then I called again. This time the call went through, I waited 18 minutes. I got a guy named Bill on the phone, he told me you couldn't help me cuz his computer was down. I called again. I got a very helpful lady who told me that my balance was .69 GB. I explained to her that I just purchased 2 GB on February 28th and it's not showing in my system. She came back and was in the middle of answering me and we got cut off. I called back after waiting a long period of time I talked to another person, the system was down and he couldn't help me.I then did a chat through the app. That guy was pretty helpful... But then he got stuck because his system went down.I'm moving my service.... Don't get TracFone! Check out other reviews before you decide. You'll see I'm not the only one having troubles with the rollover minutes. Problem is I didn't read the reviews before I started my adventure with TracFone.Good luck.",Buyer beware,2023-03-05,1.0

I got them on sale for $12, and am very satisfied with that (got Rosegold version). Tested on a call and they work great. Podcasts/spoken recordings are fine. Music is also fine for the price and ease of wearing. No complaints really. I actually like the control buttons on these better than my AirPods, which can sometimes get confused on skipping or stopping. There is an 'EQ' button which isn't top notch (don't hear that much difference between types), but is usable (goes through 6 music-type choices: Pop, Rock, Vocal, Jazz, Bass, Classic). A nice little added feature.Would I pay $25 for them? If I weren't watching every penny, yeah probably! They're just more comfortable than the pods in my ears all the time. (And they are sufficiently comfortable, too.) I'm trying to get back to listening to music instead YouTube podcasts all the time. LOL And these are definitely helping for that. They just feel like I should be listening to music with them, you know?I only started using them today, so no idea yet on battery life yet. But they did turn themselves off when I forgot to (leaving them unused for a while). So that's good. :)UPDATE: After several weeks of use, I can add a bit more: 1) The range on these are fantastic. I can leave my phone at one end of our house and walk to the other and suffer no degradation of signal at all. I sometimes forget where I left the phone! (Our house is a little under 1500 sq ft., so not a mansion, but my earbuds don't always reach that far.) 2) I have yet to find the end of a charge, so it does last a good long time. 3) Audio on the mic is fine; no problem using it on phone calls, as told to me by those I'm calling.

The phone is light weight, could be a pro or con for you. The camera lenses are sleek, they are not ugly and bulky like some of the other cheap phones. The camera quality is acceptable. It's not the deal breaker for me. The corners of the phone are nice and rounded giving it a sleek appearance and feel. It's got a slim profile and feels easy to hold, not large or bulky. The phone is plastic but that's not noticeable once you put a case on it anyway. The phone speed is fast enough. It's not too glitchy. The main drawback for me is the lower screen quality than other phones in it's price range like the umidigi. The screen almost appears faded. My usual phone is a Samsung Galaxy s 22+. The umidigi had a surprisingly similar screen quality for such a cheap phone. Whereas, this doogee has about what you would expect from $100 phone. The screen looks grainy a bit and the color hues are off. I also don't like that the time display area at the top left of the screen is partially cut off. It is misaligned. So you can't see the top of the number. It's still functional I guess because I can still tell what time is displayed but it represents a quality and design issue to me. Also, when the case is on it the fingerprint reader accuracy is decreased. Due to the placing. The speaker volume is good. The phone seemed unable to maintain as good as a connection to my wifi as other devices. I didn't test it out long but I noticed it dropped a connection multiple times so I ended up turning off the wifi. That was another reason I decided to return it.

Because after I and placed my sim and went through the setup process.The phone repeatedly told me that is could not connect to wifi after it already had.Then the phone went into something called extreme battery saver and we could not turn it off thus causing a black screen with only six apps showing. We had to use the virtual assistant to get into settings  because it would not allow any access to anything else in the phone.This finally resulted in me having to call Amazon support.  They have no data or information to trouble shoot this phone.  So the had me factory restore it.

I stumbled across this phone on Amazon and gave it a try.It does do all I need it to do. I do not need a camera or 5G access. It set up quickly and runs everything. The only downside of sorts is that within the OS a lot of options that higher end phones have are missing in this one. For example, on better Samsung phones there's an option to turn off notifications for using a slow charger. Since I'm using the van's cigarette lighter for power, I can't use the OEM charger. Every time I start the van I get that stupid notification that's half the screen and I have to turn it off. In the power settings there are only a couple options, not the laundry list that Samsung has.It's definitely not going to replace my high-end Samsung, but it will do.

Trying to locate a compatible charging cord for at home, I did, but was displayed that it was “slow charging” and to “use the proper charger”. 🫤  I felt anxious to see it work, there not being many compatible phones for Tello service with a T-Mobile connection.  As soon as installing my Sim card given by Tello, it displayed T-Mobile on the screen, so I then I went thru settings and made test calls / texts, and was working.ANYWAY…after trying the phone, there are some features that I am liking, so I suppose it is okay, but I am unhappy to have not had the charger included (and as others have stated, it NOT being a “type C” as described in the product information, but rather a Micro USB), not provided, AND feel I  should be refunded something since apparently it being refurbished, which I had contacted the seller and Amazon, regarding.*To add from product description:  “Product will come with a SIM removal tool, a charger and a charging cable”.  As mentioned, the charging cable was missing, AND the other items.  I had to order a separate charging cable, getting only a small amount credited by Amazon, and NOT from the seller who made NO effort to correct the error.  (It figures that this would occur with a phone I would want, since it works with chosen service).* The seller had said it “was up to Amazon”, though the seller was the one making the error.  I was told I would need to send back to get another phone sent, in order to be refunded.  The thing is, I did not want to fiddle with the Sim sent by Tello, in case it could get damaged, then would need THAT replaced, also.  After speaking to Amazon, was told that I could get a slight refund.  So, I unknowingly paid $108.41 for a refurb. phone sent by the seller, yet those being listed at $48.00.  This is the first time I have had an issue like this and not too happy. 😒So, the phone itself seems okay, I like that navigating is quick, the phone being smaller and more lightweight, the features being straightforward, and the overall look is fine.  I was initially overshadowed by the product-receiving issue, and was unsure about the phone.  After getting a proper charging cord, I saw that it charges more quickly, seems to last a bit for my needs.  The phone seems fine, I am just angry at the seller - LincolnWood or something, for the mishap.","It was received without a charger..phone seems not bad, review is overshadowed by sender error.",2023-05-28,3.0

A few additional apps offered during setup from both TracFone and Google Play Store per usual but keep in mind some random games and social apps like TikTok and SnapChat will randomly install itself after you connect it to Wi-Fi during the setup process even after the setup is complete which takes up a whole gigabyte of storage but you can uninstall these apps right afterward (Facebook is pre-installed into the system so you can only disable that). However keep in mind right afterward you finish the setup of the device, update it to android 12 before putting any data on it because it might get stuck and you'd have to factory reset it to do the setup all over again, after that everything is good just do the setup again and remove the apps that install themselves and you're good to go. Another downside is that some notable standard features such as sound customizations like amplifier and equalizer are missing from the settings as well as screen recorder/screenshot tools are also missing from the quick panel even though those are also supposed to come standard with all One UI devices. I can't seem to find Good Lock in the Galaxy Store and Sound Assistant doesn't work right without the sound equalizer feature. I understand it has no Bixby features since this is a budget device and not a regular mid range A series or flagship, but some of the essentials I like using on my other One UI devices aren't there or are supported. However in the end this device has amazing hardware for the cheap price and the functionality can really be amazing for what you'll get out of a budget phone. -Kai Edward Bannon, Android technology expert","Great cheap phone, but be careful when upgrading to android 12, battery can last all week.",2022-12-27,4.0,RWDLO9U84QVNS,foobarproof,1.0,"this would be a good phone if it were possible to disable or uninstal OneUI, but alas, it is not possible to avoid OneUI so the phone is quite slow as shipped. it got to decent by doing the following: install apps, including gboard, choose browser, and the standard google apps for contacts phone and messages. also disable battery use, notifications and data use wherever possible for all the samsung apps and wherever possible disable or uninstall samsung apps.",good hardware hobbled by OneUI but.....,2023-08-10,3.0

This was their direct response:“This is the latest version of the system. security updates match the system version. Not every software version will be updated. If a new security updates is released, you can view it on your phone.”That is a categorically false statement. My previous phone ran Android 11 and the latest security update from it was April 2023. If OnePlus can release updates for a 2½  year-old phone then humidity can release updates for a <1 year-old phone. This race is very serious red flags about Umidigi and their ability to provide a safe mobile environment.Original:I've always carried flagship Android phones, but after OnePlus and Verizon ruined my last phone with a terrible Android upgrade and then NO bug fixes I had to find something new. I was tired of buying from Verizon because their phones take forever to get updates/upgrades because they force every phone maker (except Apple and Google because they don't allow it) to customize Android for Verizon, forcing bloatware like Verizon Messages, Verizon location services, and other unnecessary apps, none of which are you allowed to uninstall. Oh, and don't forget, the Verizon malware app, ""Verizon App Manager""  (that used to be called DT Ignite)that installs unwanted apps on your phone without your permission or approval. Also, Verizon's fake 5G network is no faster than 4G in most places.So that said I went looking for unlocked, factory default alternatives. Samsung and Google both offer these, but at very high price points so I kept looking. Then I stumbled on this Umidigi Bison 2 Pro. For $200 its specs looked too good to be true, but for $200 I had to try it. I have, mostly, not been disappointed. Here's what I've found in a few days of using it:1) Let me get this out of the way first. Support is by email ONLY and goes to China where they take at least 48 hours to reply. For $200 I'm ok with that.2) Documentation is, to say the least, basically nonexistent.3) For this to work on Verizon you have to do two things. First, change the network from Global to LTE. Second, turn on VoLTE. Once those are done this phone will connect to Verizon, including using WiFi Calling if you wish and Verizon Network Extenders (I have one in my house, because otherwise I can't hear you now).4) Performance has been exceptional for a phone of this price. No, you're not going to get Samsung S23 Pro or an iPhone 14 Pro performance, but day-to-day apps like email, social media, banking, etc work great with no  launching or moving around inside the apps.5) this phone has an option for an external microSD card. As with other Androids with this capability, the microSD card can be configured to either act as part of the phone, meaning the card is encrypted and can't be moved to a different phone, where apps will install by default as well as their data, or the microSD card can be configured as an external storage device that will not be encrypted but that you cannot install apps on. My experience with this is the microSD card, I bought a SanDisk Extreme, is it's less than reliable. Quite often the phone would pop up and say the microSD card was not inserted please reinsert it, powering the phone down and then back on got it to see the microSD card again. I finally just moved my apps back to the internal 256GB memory and set up Sandisk Memory Zone (free in the Play Store and also has no ads!). This app can be scheduled to automatically backup your photos, videos, contacts, messages, etc to your microSD card. Takes all of 2 minutes to set up.6) The display is bright and crisp, easily visible in bright sunlight. Unlike some Android phones the auto brightness feature actually works quite well. Auto brightness changes the brightness significantly quicker than other Androids I've owned. Again, no you're not going to get a top-of-the line Samsung or Apple display here, but it's 90 HZ refresh rate makes using it very nice and colors are deep and rich.7) Now let's talk about battery life. So far it's been okay, but as in other reviews online, this definitely does not give you the battery life of some other phones that have similar or even slightly smaller batteries. Some of this could be due to my time configuring a new phone, I don't allow one Android to copy everything from an old Android I would rather set things up to start with. Copying from one phone to another works great from iPhone to iPhone but it just has never worked well from Android to Android. I'll use it for another week or two and try to remember to come back and update this at that time.8) Despite their claims, charging is not fast. It comes with an 18 Watt charger and USB-C cable, but charging this phone using the same charger, it's a SlimQ GAN 4-port 100 watt charger that I only have two devices plugged into, it takes far longer to charge from 10% to 100%, then my previous OnePlus 8 does. It doesn't seem to make a difference whether I use their charging block or the SlimQ. So while for most people charging is not an issue if they do it overnight, if you need a quick top off during the day don't expect it to be fast.8) The overall build of this phone might be the best feeling phone I have ever owned. Since it carries military drop spec ratings, this phone feels like it's built like a brick, and not in a bad way. The phone is solid, it doesn't feel cheap nor does it feel like they used lower quality materials for a $200 phone. The phone comes with its case built into it with very good protection on the corners and back, though I would have preferred that the case covered the small camera bump. Speaking of the case, the only glass on this phone is in the front, unlike some of the other phone manufacturers who have insisted on putting glass on the back of the case that's easily broken. Since the case is built in you will not need to spend money on a new case. That also means you can't change the case, but honestly it feels great in your hands, it's smooth and quite functional.9) Camera quality is something I've had a chance to test a lot with, but as you can see from the attached photos colors are rich and well reproduced, at least in sunlight. I'm not expecting it to be the quality of my iPhone 13 Pro Max 1TB, but that phone cost $1600.9) this phone has built-in sensors for barometer and temperature. The temperature sensor can be used to read human body temperature or object temperature.10) This phone ships with Android 12 and given the $200 cost I'm not expecting a lot of upgrades, but at $200 I can just replace it every year with the next version of the same phone.That said, this phone ships with April 2022 Android security update. There really can't be any excuse for that, I have reached out the manufacturer to find out when that will be corrected. Since this is a very, very vanilla flavor of android, it should be very simple for them to put out Android security updates on a regular basis.11) Following up on #10, the only OEM software that ships with this are tools to utilize the sensors on the phone. See  included screenshot. The temperature and barometric pressure sensors seem to be quite accurate. I have to say, the picture hanging app and the protractor app are pretty slick, and not something I've seen on a lot of other phones.12) Since this doesn't ship with many OEM apps, it ships with generic Google apps, most of which you cannot remove even if you want to. I, for example, never use Duo but it's stuck here. You can disable it, but you can't remove it. It's unfortunate that Google has such high opinion of itself that it has to force people to keep their apps on a phone. If their apps are really that good, people would install them or leave them installed and use them.13) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity have been smooth and error-free. I have connected this phone to multiple Wi-Fi networks in multiple locations, paired it with a Plantronics headset, and paired it with my car.14) One slick feature of this $200 phone is it two customizable orange buttons. One on the lower right and one on the middle left. You have three choices for each button, single click, double click, and long press. I honestly haven't figured out what I'm going to do with all of them, though I did configure the lower right one for double click screenshots.14) biometric scanning is done on the power button on the right side in the middle. It's a little awkward coming from the OnePlus 8 that has on-screen fingerprint, but I much prefer this because that will allow me to use a tempered glass screen protector. The phone does ship with a screen protector pre-installed, but it's plastic and I prefer tempered glass.15) This phone has a 3.5 mm audio jack, something not found on any high-end phone and most others have ditched them as well. This is a welcome change in my older car it doesn't have a Bluetooth stereo.Anyways, that's my initial review of the Umidigi Bison 2 Pro phone. Like I said, with the lack of updates and the fact that it is only a $200 phone, I could replace this in a year with another $200 version of this phone and not lose any sleep over it, but if it is as durable as it feels now, I may not have to do that, assuming the manufacturer comes up with some updates. Give it a try, as long as you come at it with the right expectations, I think you will very much enjoy this phone.","Wow for the price, but beware..",2023-06-03,4.0,R1UU9PL6XRY6KZ,Ron Novak,7.0,"SEE REVISION 3 BELOW…Revision 3At 30 days, the second Bison 2 Pro I have tested (bought) wouldn’t boot after shutting down and attempting a restart. After an hour of messing, I discovered that you can force a reboot by holding down both volume buttons and the power button through a reboot cycle (mine would get to the fist restart screen and repeat every 15 seconds)(such instructions should be in the “user manual”, and the “technical staff” have yet to answer my request for help). I don’t want to worry about this nonsense on a trip in a foreign city or on a trail in the bush. I don’t want to have to carry my iPhone 8 as a backup…….I have downgraded this device to 2 stars because of the unreliability of the 2 units I have worked with, and because of the mediocre quality of the camera and the device’s inability to deliver quality sound through my hearing aids….. Not to mention that it can’t automatically restart Verizon VOLTE after the signal has been lost for some reason. The “technical staff” offer no help in correcting any of the problems with this device, they just suggest that you should up your rating…… Worthless….. (Eva and Evan, are you listening?)If you buy one, I hope you have better luck than I have had. The Bison is a great concept that I really wanted to work. But the two units I had failed to deliver….. I may re-try in a year when the product line had matured, but not now. I have ordered an F3 and hope it is as good as the A11 I bought for my ex-wife…. I’ll comment on that device after I have used it for a while…….. UMIDIGI products offer good bang-for-the-buck, if you can get them to keep running past a month! Hope springs eternal!Revision 2I received the replacement Bison 2 Pro on 01 March, around four days after I requested the replacement, good for Amazon and Umidigi! I have used the replacement exclusively since 01/03. As I mentioned, it connects with Verizon without a problem and it connects to my hearing aids with Bluetooth as well. The other day, I connected it to my 2019 Volvo with Bluetooth (the Volvo doesn't have an audio jack) so I can play music from the phone through the car's infotainment system. It all works.I have been emailing the tech support folks at Umidigi who are concerned with the failure of the first phone and the condition of the replacement. They seem genuinely concerned and want feedback on their products. Asa retired engineer, I'm probably giving them more than they want......In the meantime, I bought an Umidigi G 1 Max, which looked like it had the same specs as the Bison. However, while it would connect to Verizon, but the phone and texting didn't work. After hours of research and talking with a Verizon ""technical support"" person, I have new knowledge about the reason the G 1 didn't work and the Bison does. Verizon uses VOLTE 4G and bands 2, 4, 13, and 66. The G1 lacks band 13, QED...... I returned the device to Amazon and bought a Umidigi A11. I wanted a lighter, smaller phone for everyday use. The A11 has band 13 (along with the other requirements) and it works with Verizon!BOTH OF THESE CELLPHONES COST AROUND HALF OF THE COST OF A NEW iPhone 13!!!!!!! I will not upgrade to the iPhone 13 from my dying iPhone 8..... Not going back to Apple, EVER!ORIGINAL.....I have changed my evaluation from 2 stars to 4 stars for the Bison and the A11 due to the quality of the devices and the conversations with the staff at Umidigi. I may give the products the last star if they continue to give good service in the coming months......So far - so good on the Bison 2Pro phone. I bought it to replace an iPhone 8 for a trip to Europe later this year. First hurdle, does it work with Verizon? Yes it does, however I haven’t officially set it up with them, just plugged in the SIM and made a call and texted. Second hurdle, does it work with my Bluetooth hearing aids? Yes it does, beams sound directly into my head….. Next hurdle, can I adapt my brain away from the world of iPhone? We’ll see over the next few months. Good news, I have used Dragon Touch tablets for years and am used to Android there.REVISION:After 2 weeks, the Bison screen has gone to black and white, and has started blinking on and off. The on and off behavior has no relation to touching the screen or buttons. Unacceptable. I contacted the seller about the charger being DOA, but they haven’t replaced it. Asked questions indicating user error! Unacceptable behavior! I’m returning the phone for a replacement (basically, I like the phone) and we’ll see how the next one goes. I live 20 miles from Santa Fe, NM, and depend on my phone in case of emergency. Can’t have it crapping out……. See Revision 2, above.....",I quit after second Bison 2 Pro crapped,2023-02-16,2.0

It's taking me a few days to copy over all my apps and settings (I run a lot of weird stuff apparently), so I haven't stress-tested it yet in real-life conditions.  I've only had it around for three days or so.- The speakers are really bad.  This is surprising, because I'm upgrading from a TCL A1X.  The TCL 30 Z is the same entry-level price point, so the downgrade here is a shock.  However, if I really cared about speakers, I shouldn't have purchased this entry-level device.- Android 12 is not my bag.

A. Mitchell,7.0,"The Umidigi A15C is a great inexpensive phone all things considered.I have had several Umidigi phones in the past and I can say from my experience they continue to improve and provide a good value for people looking for reasonable price vs performance phones. I purchased the space gray color and was it was received very quickly so Kudos for that.  The phone specs that I am usually concerned with are listed a bit later in the review if you want to see that level of details otherwise here is my impression of the phone.The phone is well packaged in a recycling conscious box which includes a gray tinted semi- transparent protective case for the phone, wall charger, charging cord, sim tool, and small paper manual covering the basics of the phone.  A plastic type screen protector is already on the phone screen so that helps a bit.The fingerprint reader is the right side power button and is easy to setup as well as fast to unlock phone unlike some of the in screen fingerprint readers of other phones.  Interestingly enough the phone can keep up with me when I am entering the 6 digit unlock pin number when required. (many other phones do not and I have to type in the pin number slowly for them to recognize all the numbers)  I don't turn on face unlock so I wont comment on that feature.I found the processor/CPU can keep up with my needs with no real lagging or pausing while using multiple apps and doing app updates.  Scrolling pages and other common browser tasks are fluid.  I don’t use my phone for games so that may be a different result.Screen is bright and clear, resolution is moderate and refresh is not noticeable so pretty nice for a lower cost phone.  Screen does get a bit overtaken in direct sunlight.The rear camera system is comprised of a 3 circle area that contains a 48Mp sensor binned down to 12Mp @ F1.8 for main camera, a 8MP Ultra-Wide Camera @ F/2.2, and a 5MP Macro Camera @ F/2.4.  Photos from the main camera, ultrawide and macro are as expected and are social media level of quality.The front selfie or video conferencing camera is a 8MP @ F/2.2 and seems to work well for Zoom calls.Wifi stays connected around the house and yard.Blue tooth connects to my speakers, headphones and car.AT&T cellular data and VoLTE calling is working provided by Red Pocket mvno sim. I did have to set the APN information for Red Pocket as usual.  It has been on Red Pocket ATT for about a week and its still calling out via VoLTE.  Phone does not seem to offer Voice calls over Wifi for Red Pocket.T-Mobile cellular data and VoLTE calling is working as provided by T-Mobile post paid sim. I did not have to set the APN information for T-Mobile.  Phone does offer Voice calls over Wifi for T-Mobile as the menu item is present and controllable when using the T-Mobile sim..Sound is very much a cell phone sound but the volume is good without heavy distortion.  Call volume for speaker phone and handheld calls is loud and clear enough for the normal environments I use a phone in. Still has a standard 3.5mm headphone jack.The specs are reasonable for the cost of the phone and include:Android 13 June security updates.  Umidigi has improved over time at providing security updates but don’t expect Android version updates and other improvements as they are typically not provided.8GB Ram with the option to increase the available memory by utilizing Rom storage space as operating memory.  I appreciate the option is available but find 8GB is perfectly acceptable for a daily use smart phone.128GB Storage memory for storage of apps, pictures and all sorts of other data.The 128GB of storage can be increased in size with the addition of a micro sd card if needed and I tried a 64GB SanDisk that worked easily.CPU is a Unisoc Tiger T606 which is an entry level octa core processor.6.7” HD+ Full View Display, Resolution: 1650 × 720, Aspect Ratio: 20.6:9,  Brightness: 500 nit (typ), and Contrast Ratio: 1500:1.

For a spare phone, a phone for your parents who aren’t used to technology, or even a kids first phone this will work for you.  The phone is reasonably responsive I didn’t feel like it was stuttering while using it.  Now while this it not a phone worth 1k or more there are a lot of things going for it. The battery is huge and lasts for days on end as a simple user for messages, web browsing, etc.  now I would not recommend this to the heavy user for gaming and other things.  But for what you’re paying this phone is a good grab. I’d highly recommend this phone for the quality and price you are paying plus you even get a screen protector and a case included and installed. No having to fuss over going out to purchase those right away or raven worrying if the screen protector will go on correctly. This phone is a must if you just need something cheap and reasonable for you to use daily for a little while.  I’m not sure how the support would go for this over time but already having android 13is great with the new customization options and full features from android it’s a great grab for someone not looking to break the bank. While this phone doesn’t compete with high end models you are getting a way bigger battery for the phone and pretty much the same software features if you’re looking for a phone to play the newest games or take the best pictures I’d say this isn’t for you and spend more money on a different phone but if you need a phone just for daily use calling text and the basics this could be the one for a small price.",Great budget phone!,2023-07-24,4.0,R16KA8PTTZPBZB,johnp2,3.0,"Long time Umidigi user.

So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",Little on the heavy side but good otherwise,2023-07-21,4.0,R26JLCYDB9ADUG,Glen Jones,12.0,"So the computer itself looks nice.

And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one.

The 13th gen i7 chip feel like it can handle anything I throw at it, with good battery life, a beautiful screen, all the little features that make it easy to use.  The software tools to work seamlessly with my other Samsung devices are handy, too; I can wirelessly use my phone or tablet as a second display for the laptop, or just use the laptop's mouse and keyboard to interact with my phone and laptop. The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop. If that's the tradeoff for having a thin device with a lid that is going to stay securely closed, though, I'm good with it.Overall, it's a great laptop and I expect to be using it as a main device for many years.",Portable and Powerful,2023-08-22,5.0,R31BLNPXMW2N0P,Josef Farkas,33.0,"This is an interesting product: it has superb video and sound performance but the rest is just average. Here are some observations.The Pros: as mentioned earlier.The Cons: 1. The hardware details on the USB ports say that it is from the 2006 Specs! Wow!2. The Taskbar can only be partially expanded to the left, the hidden icons can't be dragged out.3. The laptop can't properly connect to a Samsung A53-5G phone nor to a Samsung  S6-Lite  Tablet. It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither. Sorry Samsung, I expect another take on the design of such laptops and hope to see a star performer having a competitive price.","Superb and Excellent Video and Sound, Average rest of the components and Performance.",2023-04-20,3.0

Although the product has some positive aspects, there are areas that require attention for a more satisfying user experience.CPU Performance and Chrome Usage:One significant concern is the laptop's CPU usage when running resource-intensive tasks, such as opening/closing applications and heavily utilizing Chrome browser. As a power user who frequently works with multiple Chrome windows open simultaneously, I noticed that the CPU operates at 100% capacity, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. For users with less demanding tasks, this may not be a problem, but if you require better CPU performance for your tasks, you might want to consider other options.Mousepad Sensitivity:Another minor issue I encountered is the mousepad sensitivity when holding the laptop with one hand. The mousepad tends to get stuck, which appears to be related to the material and design of the laptop. While not a critical flaw, it's worth noting for potential buyers who value solid construction.Positive Aspects:Aside from the mentioned issues, there are several positive aspects to this laptop that I appreciate. It boasts a sleek design and appears to be well-built, except for the mousepad issue. Additionally, its overall performance is adequate for typical daily tasks, and the screen resolution provides a clear and vibrant display.",Ok for small work,2023-08-04,4.0,R28DOAK7I2DA58,Anna,0.0,Battery life is short and I don’t like the graphics on this laptop.,Not so good,2023-09-02,3.0

My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad...

It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value.

There is a slot on the bottom that can be opened in order to access something under it but  I did not try to open or upgrade the item as the specifications on this were pretty strong on stock alone. That being said you should do your research before purchasing this. Based on the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do any upgrades if you are using it for basic use. This is by no means a gaming laptop and cannot handle games as much. This laptop overall is an average size laptop. It is relatively thin but not surface book thin. The specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is not too heavy and can fit in most laptop bags. It has a quad core celeron processor which is a very basic. The ram is 12 gb which is well over the standard 8 gb for most other lower end laptops. It will definitely work for most daily usage and a bit of heavy multitasking. That being said, it is okay in terms of battery life. It really only last about four  hours on average at most on a full charge. The cooling system is not too noisy on heavy usage. It is a standard charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future. The power brick is okay but it does take up the good amount of space if you happen to plug into a surge protector. Also it does not get hot during charging but do not leave it under a blanket or anything that can keep heat in. Upon boot up of the laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick with its 512 GB SSD. I am unsure if it is an SSD or M2 drive but it boots up pretty quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. You just need to make sure you have a microsoft account and such. It does run on windows 11 and I am unsure if you can do any downgrades if you like the other windows. The bloatware is not too terrible but I tend to remove those as much as possible. The laptop also has only a 15.6 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. This is a pretty standard laptop screen size. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best on the market. It still keep the traditional two 3.0 USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the dark silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. They do feel a bit cheap but they are responsive. It will work for me but I am unsure if the keys will fade over time. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. It is sealed inside a nice bag (not sure if it is antistatic) The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it but it does have a switch on the side to turn the camera on and off which is interesting and unique to this laptop. The microphone is okay but you can hear a bit of choppiness to voice. It does pick up some surrounding noise. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually make this laptop last longer than 4 hours. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but uninstall bloatware or whatever you do not need. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. Again this is not a gaming laptop as it does not have a powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer. The processor is a simple celeron laptop which is mostly for your daily use. The processing speed is decent and it works really well for say school work. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a decent for a home use laptop. You get an average size screen but this is not a gaming laptop. It can handle some light games but nothing intense. The laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is okay. The specification is not bad at 12 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what a student may need. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work or basic computer with a single monitor connection.

So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",Little on the heavy side but good otherwise,2023-07-21,4.0,R26JLCYDB9ADUG,Glen Jones,12.0,"So the computer itself looks nice.

I charge it to 100% and then shut it down and then the next day when I turned it on it was at 50%. It said I had 1 hour and 27 minutes left to the battery life. And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can’t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don’t really know who to trust.  So that’s kind of annoying.

The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop.

The Taskbar can only be partially expanded to the left, the hidden icons can't be dragged out.3. The laptop can't properly connect to a Samsung A53-5G phone nor to a Samsung  S6-Lite  Tablet. It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither.

As a power user who frequently works with multiple Chrome windows open simultaneously, I noticed that the CPU operates at 100% capacity, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. For users with less demanding tasks, this may not be a problem, but if you require better CPU performance for your tasks, you might want to consider other options.Mousepad Sensitivity:Another minor issue I encountered is the mousepad sensitivity when holding the laptop with one hand. The mousepad tends to get stuck, which appears to be related to the material and design of the laptop. While not a critical flaw, it's worth noting for potential buyers who value solid construction.Positive Aspects:Aside from the mentioned issues, there are several positive aspects to this laptop that I appreciate.

The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad... That's not a solution.I'm sure I'll be back with more to say but this was my immediate unhappy impressionnext day update: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT ####### ### ###### ######## ###### LIGHT ON THE F6 KEY ????? It comes on when you push mute,,,,which, I ALWAYS have my computer on mute. I realise I could just turn down the volume but I want to push the mute button. And now when I do, this annoying orange light comes on that's a tiny sun in a dark room, very distracting. I hate it and now have put .99 cent nail polish on my 750$ machine.FEW DAYS LATER: the nail polish is holding up, but using this thing with only WoW running on it (that's it, that's all that on it) it's like being on the moores on a windy night.

I was looking for a replacement for a three year old model. A brand new version of what I got retails for around $1100. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value. Unless you're looking for the fastest gaming machine this will service any normal home or business user.","Excellent value for a fast and compact laptop, vendor rapidly fixed a problem!",2023-09-06,5.0,R3MSJUFKWY46D4,justreviewing,0.0,"Received this product today and cannot power it on.

There is a slot on the bottom that can be opened in order to access something under it but  I did not try to open or upgrade the item as the specifications on this were pretty strong on stock alone. That being said you should do your research before purchasing this. Based on the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do any upgrades if you are using it for basic use. This is by no means a gaming laptop and cannot handle games as much. This laptop overall is an average size laptop. It is relatively thin but not surface book thin. The specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is not too heavy and can fit in most laptop bags. It has a quad core celeron processor which is a very basic. The ram is 12 gb which is well over the standard 8 gb for most other lower end laptops. It will definitely work for most daily usage and a bit of heavy multitasking. That being said, it is okay in terms of battery life. It really only last about four  hours on average at most on a full charge. The cooling system is not too noisy on heavy usage. It is a standard charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future. The power brick is okay but it does take up the good amount of space if you happen to plug into a surge protector. Also it does not get hot during charging but do not leave it under a blanket or anything that can keep heat in. Upon boot up of the laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick with its 512 GB SSD. I am unsure if it is an SSD or M2 drive but it boots up pretty quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. You just need to make sure you have a microsoft account and such. It does run on windows 11 and I am unsure if you can do any downgrades if you like the other windows. The bloatware is not too terrible but I tend to remove those as much as possible. The laptop also has only a 15.6 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. This is a pretty standard laptop screen size. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best on the market. It still keep the traditional two 3.0 USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the dark silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. They do feel a bit cheap but they are responsive. It will work for me but I am unsure if the keys will fade over time. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. It is sealed inside a nice bag (not sure if it is antistatic) The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it but it does have a switch on the side to turn the camera on and off which is interesting and unique to this laptop. The microphone is okay but you can hear a bit of choppiness to voice. It does pick up some surrounding noise. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually make this laptop last longer than 4 hours. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but uninstall bloatware or whatever you do not need. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. Again this is not a gaming laptop as it does not have a powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer. The processor is a simple celeron laptop which is mostly for your daily use. The processing speed is decent and it works really well for say school work. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a decent for a home use laptop. You get an average size screen but this is not a gaming laptop. It can handle some light games but nothing intense. The laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is okay. The specification is not bad at 12 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what a student may need. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work or basic computer with a single monitor connection.

Mediocre gaming machine.,198.0,R389VS0DLFEXDM,5.0,Review from a non gamer user,58.0,R31FPYRL3G3L2G,5.0,Great entry level gaming laptop,5.0,R1KGQC8UBSP9TG,5.0,An Absolutely Amazing Laptop,1.0,R1ZP747Q489DTI,5.0,It’s been a while since I’ve given 5 stars: See Review,103.0,R1083B196FHTFL,Lee T.,198.0,"I bought this as a replacement for a Dell Inspiron that decided to abruptly fail.  I had been wanting to get a laptop that had a dedicated graphics card, a backlit keyboard, good system specs, upgradeability, at a good price.Throw in the fact that Asus includes one year of ACCIDENT PROTECTION, and this is a winner!!  While only having this laptop for a couple of days (Edit: Weeks now) now, I am so far, not disappointed with the purchase.  Here are my initial impressions, the pros and the cons.  Pros:  Audio:  The onboard speakers are quite adequate.  While not some of the ""loudest"" they are more than needed for watching youtube, hearing system alerts, recreational music,  video calls, stuff like that.  I have not yet tried the speakers while gaming.  [Edit] Ok these speakers are definitely high volume.  Watching youtube, I have the speakers at 50% and the audio of the video at 5% !  And I'm worried that the people across the hall might be kept awake while I insomnia the night away.  Also for the fact that these are laptop speakers, the quality is REALLY good.  I've been listening to MP3s on this machine and its been quite satisfactory.  I had a soundbar on my older ""gaming"" laptop, because the speakers were crap.  Definitely not the case here.  The screen:  The screen is very good resolution, quite bright, and very comfortable to read on.  Whether in regular daylight, a lit room, or in the dark.  I have not yet tested it as far as gaming.  CON:  This screen is SMALL.  Coming from laptops with 17.3"" screens, this is quite an adjustment.  The screen does have very small, thin bezels, so it does a good job giving you the most screen for footprint.  However, as somebody who does a lot of video and text editing, this is not what I would really want.  If I were working with 3d models, I would definitely want an external monitor or two.  It also does NOT fold flat.  This is no problem at all for me.  But for those that are looking for a device that will do so, this is not it.  [Edit]  Finding the settings to adjust saturation, color balance, stuff like that, I can't find it!  And when I'm editing images, this screen has a very high yellow saturation.  So unless I can find, or download something that will let me see colors the way their meant to be, and external monitor is going to another costly expenditure. (Edit: After a lot of web searching, I've fixed the problem with too much yellow saturation.  It's a windows 11 problem, not the machine.  Poorly implemented color scheme files by Microsoft in the windows 11)  Build Quality.  So far, this machine is quite sturdy.  The materials are good, and it doesn't feel like I am going to break it.  Or worry about having problems with it in my backpack.  Everything fits together very nicely.  Also when removing the bottom shell to get into the guts of the machine, I didn't feel like I was going to break it, or anything else, while using the spreader to pop the clips apart.  I do recommend the proper tool for the job tho.  Don't just try to jerk it apart after taking all those screws out.  Keyboard:  As with any new laptop, getting used to the key layout is almost always a chore.  There is no unified layout for the specialty keys.  For just typing, the layout is REALLY good.  The keys are spaced together Just Right, and doesn't cause me to make as many typos as my larger machines, where the keys are spaced further apart.  They are very tactile, and make very little noise.  They don't have the feel of mechanical keyswitches.  They may be membrane keys, or a combination.  [Edit]  Membrane keys.  I would rather have switches personally, as it's less to replace, if one key, or a couple of keys fail.  But they work really well in this machine.Other than when I have the machine sitting awkwardly on my lap, I have absolute NO problems typing on this, and can hit the keys that I'm aiming for quite intuitively, with very little in the way or typos induced by the machine.  The backlighting is GREAT.  I can very clearly see and read the keys in low, and no light.  I do wish that they could use combined colors, so that I could set one part of the keyboard to one color, and a different part to a different color.  Which really assists in gaming, using keyboard shortcuts.  But for me, that's not a dealbreaker.  I can read them in the dark, and that is what I was wanting.  The layout for the specialty keys is ""Fairly"" standard.  Tho the sleep mode key being on F11 and especially the airplane mode being on F12 is something that is not a wise choice as those are pretty common shortkeys for quite a few programs.  Mouse:  The mouse functioned quite well, right out of the box.  I do wish that it was set a bit further to the left, in an offset style.  As the butts of my thumbs do pass across the pad.  But for a laptop this size, you get what you get.  The cursor sweeps across the screen quite well, with minimal effort, right out of the box.  Big plus.  It also uses hardwared mouse buttons.  Not corner clicks on the mousepad.  Honestly, thats a HUGE win, IMO.  The corner click system I've never really liked, its an area that collects dust and crud, and has to be cleaned.  Whether this suits you or not, well, that's individual taste ;)CON: This mousepad collects oil.  It collects oil REALLY bad.  Weight:  This machine is VERY PORTABLE.  The weight is quite light.  I was actually very surprised when I opened the box.  I almost wondered if there was something missing.  Between the machine itself, and the power brick, this is QUITE light.  My Sager laptop is a brick.  The powerbrick is huge and weighs a ton.  This machine is most definitely a very welcomed upgrade from that!  Noise:  This machine really surprised me as far as the (lack of) noise from the fans.  I have had cooling pads with fans in them that have made more noise than the cooling system in  this machine!  ASUS has really outdone themselves with the cooling system.  Tho as stated, I haven't tried gaming on this thing yet.  But so far, the noise level from this is  quite pleasant, and very unobtrusive.  [Edit] Ok, so the fans have kicked on.  They are no means loud, compared to some of the other laptops that I have owned.  It's actually pretty subdued, for laptop fans.Somebody else had mentioned that they sound kind of like airplane turbines.  Yeah!  They actually kind of do! :D  Which is cool!  But again, they're fairly quiet.  I seriously doubt that they would bother anybody except for maybe a fairly light sleeper.  Heat:  Again, a very pleasant surprise!  I've run this machine a straight, solid 24 hours, and have not had the fans kick on high.  There is no hot air blowing out of the side ports, and it's extrememly comfortable on the lap.  (One of my HP laptops has literally left bald spots on my legs from the heat!)  Upgrades:  There are two slots for RAM.  Which are the standard open the clips, slide the new one in/out variety.  This makes upgrading the RAM very simple.  There are two slots for m2 type Solid State boards, which are spaced widely apart.  This is not only making it very easy for install/removal, but also for heat control.  Next to the battery, (NOT removable!) [Edit]  (The battery IS removable.  Just not externally like older laptops.  You have to open it up, disconnect it, and then it can be removed/swapped. )  There is a connector for a 2.5"" SATA drive.  Which included connectors.  I myself don't like the idea of putting a drive that close to the battery.  But considering how little this machine is, and how little space there is inside... it has to go somewhere, right?  And at least, we can add a 3rd drive!  Boot up:  With the operating system installed on a SSD, this machine boots up really fast.  Granted windows will really slow it down when it decides to do a mandatory update.  But without those, I press the power up button and within seconds, I'm typing in my password.  Very nice!  Edit 3/25/23:  After installing 32gb of ram, the first boot up was a tad slow as the BIOS updated to the new system specs.  However.  After that.  Oh lord!  I hit the power button and I could log into the machine almost instantly.  Speed:  So far the processor/RAM/SSD combination is a winner.  Even Adobe Photoshop CS6 fires right up.  Haven't tried it with gaming so far, but so far, my intensive programs aren't suffering any kind of slow-down, stuttering, or lag.  The exception to this is my browser.  I run A LOT OF TABS when I am surfing.  And browsers are heavy RAM hogs.  Yeah, one of my browsers is getting a lot of hesitation.  But that will go away when I upgrade RAM.  Edit 3/25/23:  I've just installed 32gb of T-Force Zeus DDR4  3200 CL-22 Memory to the machine.  It was super easy as far as the computer was concerned.  The packaging for the memory gave me more trouble than putting it into the laptop, LOL.  But then, I'm also a computer technician, so your mileage may very depending on your experience level.  The machine now boots up at 9% memory usage.  The clockspeed is reporting at 2933.  This is not a defect in the laptop.  This is the BIOS not automatically being set to run memory at higher speeds.  You can look up the instructions of how to do this online.  It takes a few minutes.  But do so on another machine, as you will need to be able to read the instructions while this laptop boots up.  Look up ""How to enable XMP to run your RAM at full speed"".CONS  Size:  As I said before, this is a very small, portable machine.  In that aspect it is fantastic!  However.  The palm rest is small enough that if you use an external mouse  there is VERY little room on the palmrest to put a mouse on it, much less use it.  I am constantly running the mouse over the arrow keys and part of the numpad.  This has caused me problems as those keys interact with programs, when I don't want them to!  This for me, is a huge con, as I really do use a laptop ON my LAP.  The screen is also small.  While I don't have very good eyes anymore, it's clear and easy to read.  But for some of the applications that I use my machines for, a larger, external monitor is going to be a must.  Windows 11:  This is a personal choice.  I myself believe that Microsoft went in a very, very bad direction with the latest release of their OS.  I will be backtracking the Operating System on this machine backwards to Windows 10 at the very first opportunity.  [Edit]  I really do hate this operating system.  The look of it is similar, but much different in ways that I don't like.  I also do not like the way that MS did the new taskbar.  The right click context menus are also way, way different, and very much not to my liking. [Edit] I found how to revert the context menus, looking around on the web.Especially since the changes that they made to the right click context menus are NOT compatible with a lot of the software that I use.  Disassembly:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  Taking this machine apart to get to the guts is actually really simple.  There are 11 screws holding the plate underneath to  the machine.  They are easy to take out, and the plate is fairly easy to remove.  HOWEVER.  These screws are all different lengths!  So you HAVE to keep track of which one goes where!  NON-Removable  External battery:  This is an obvious con.  Not only can you not carry around a spare, but you cannot easily replace the existing one, if it goes bad. [Edit] As I noted before, yeah the battery can be replaced, but you have to open up the lower shell.  It's not a hot swappable battery that we got used to on older machines.  RAM slots.  Ok, this was a huge let down for me.  I was planning to simply take out the RAM from the machine that died, and put it in here to upgrade the low 8gb of ram that  it comes with.  It doesn't FIT!!  The pin arrangement is different, and the slot in the board is spaced further to the left.  I will have to look up what RAM this thing takes and purchase new boards to perform the upgrade.HOWEVER.  And this... this is awesome.  There's only ONE 8gb stick in this machine, when it arrived.  NOT paired 2x 4gb sticks.  What that means is that I can just throw another 8gb stick in here, and double the memory.  Without having to sacrifice a stick that was already in it.  Because it wasn't already in it!  Or, I could just throw in a single 16gb stick and instantly TRIPLE the ram, at significantly less coss.  I'm reading conflicting information about how much this machine supports.  Most say it's 32gb, while some say 64gb.I am more inclined to believe 32, but I don't know for sure.  Expansion slots:  Pretty much all of the connectors for USB, Video Out, and audio are all on the left side.  This, since an external monitor is going to be a must, will cause  some arrangement problems.  It could cause problems for people that also will be using this on a desk.  One thing that I love about my older Dell laptops is that they have some  of the afore mentioned ports at the BACK of the machine.  Or at the Rear Corners.  More USB ports would also be a very nice addition.  No Optical Drive.  Maybe I'm just a dinosaur, but I do miss having an optical drive bay.  Being able to watch DVDs or burn disk was a habit from way back in the day.  Or just taking the tray out, and swapping in a 2.5 sata drive through an adapter was also a very seriously nice option.  Ahhhh, progress LOL.  8 Gb of ram:  This combined with Win11, the LOAD of software marked with ASUS, and that crapware McCaffee pre-installed...  the machine is running at around 50% memory usage.  The Asus Monitoring software, along with the bloated goat OS is taking up quite bit of the system memory.  After uninstalling worthless McCaffee, I've cut it down to about 40% with 8gb RAM.  And as stated above, this machine takes different RAM boards than those used by machines from a few years ago.  512 GB Solid State Storage:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  512 is quite good, in comparison to what similar machines are offering, which is half that.  At the same  pricepoint as these machines.  And as mentioned above, the machine will support up to 1tb storage boards, or SATA drive.  So there is definitely room for expansion with this machine.  However, to do so, IS an added expense.  And if you are planning on adding on a lot of games to this, you are definitely going to want to expand on the storage capacity!  Fortunately, it does have a sata slot.  Which means that you can add in a 1tb sata drive for considerably less money.Overall, the only thing that I'm going to complain about, is the size of the palm rests.  It's very comfortable for typing on.  But, as most of the applications that I use, I need those concise, accurate mouse movements.  And not having room to use a mouse on this machine is going to be a problem.That, and having to purchase windows 10 and what I will have to go through reinstalling drivers.  But again, that's a personal choice.",A great portable machine for daily use.  Mediocre gaming machine.,2022-12-18,5.0,R31WZZJHAD6UJ6,RSP,3.0,"So until the 13th generation of Intel CPU, the I series CPUs supported both EFI and bios legacy OS installation and booting yet this laptop has had that option removed. There is also no way to disable TPM which means Windows 11 just gets to install itself whenever it wants and you don't get a choice unless you want to solo boot Linux. Oh and you wanted to do a uefi/legacy bios Windows Linux dual boot so that they don't cross contaminate? F*** you says Asus, because as I previously mentioned that's not an option because they removed it. Also if you bought this laptop because of its promises to be easy to upgrade, it wasn't offensively bad but it has no right marketing itself that way, it was still fairly annoying to get the back plate off. As another note they used multiple different sizes of screw to hold in the back plate and only one of them is captive... Dell latitude e6410 from 2011 had only three screws of the same size and one of them was captive. I won't ask to return it unless something seriously bad goes wrong but my first day impressions are pretty bad. Oh also Aunt asus's website they will tell you that this laptop only supports 32 GB of RAM but I currently have 64 GB of RAM on it and it registers all of it... You can tell from Windows task Manager that they artificially make it so you can't access two of the ram slots it was supposed to have as well so they further undermine the theme of upgradability. It does come with the gddr6 1650, and to this device is credit when I put it through hell playing about 10 hours of video games yesterday, it kept the GPU very cool, however the laptop's underside got almost certainly OSHA violation level of hot, so under no circumstances should you buy this for business usage.Ultimately it did however over perform benchmarks I had seen previously on YouTube in Halo infinite and the performance was not bad. I will say with all of this bad it is still the best asus product I have used thus far, I will update this review again if that changes.",Very Underwhelming and it has the worst UEFI/BIOS I have ever interacted with,2023-02-11,3.0

You never know if you're going to get a hidden gem or an incompetently rebuilt piece of garbage. I have bought about a dozen of them, and promptly returned just more than half.This laptop is by far the most completely refurbed PC I have purchased. It looks new--the screen, the body, even the touchpad (which almost always shows wear) look untouched. It is definitely the nicest laptop I've had. The specs are exactly as listed, down to DDR4 memory and a battery that shows only 24 previous discharge/recharge cycles, far better than most refurbs.A word of advice for purchasers trying to figure out if a purchased refurb will work for them: -Don't expect anything to work well right out of the box. You will have to spend some time getting it in running order. Think of your time spent as balancing the $ you saved buying refurbished! (No, this isn't because the refurbisher didn't do their job. Once they get everything working, they will only do a clean install of Windows. The rest is up to you, just like it would be with a new computer.) -The first thing any Windows machine when you finish the guided set up (IF you connected to a wifi or wired network) is start installing Windows updates. (You can check progress by selecting ""Check for updates"" from the start menu.) Until all updates are finished, it will be slow. It might even restart seemingly at random. Once you think all updates are installed, reboot and check for updates until it shows ""You're up to date"". This can take quite some time with a slow network connection, so be sure you're using fast wifi or even plug in an ethernet cable until ALL updates are done. -While updates are installing, check the specs to make sure they are what you bought. Don't assume. The built-in Windows System Information app is a good place to start. There are lots of free apps for reporting on the HDD, memory, and battery. Check Google. If ANYTHING seems off, ask the seller about it. If you don't like the answer, return it! -Next go to the manufacturer's support website and install all available driver updates (including BIOS!). I can't oversell the importance here. Many manufacturers have an app you can download to streamline this process (for HP it is HP Support Assistant). NOTE: If something stops working during this step (function keys or bluetooth are the most likely things to stop working), Google away until you find a solution. Someone has run into the same problem before, and the solution is probably there to be found. -After these steps, you should have a fully functional computer. Test it out and see if it actually meets your needs. If not, contact the seller. If you aren't happy with the response, return it!One word of warning: the touchpad is textured. I can see this bothering some people, but I kind of like it. It makes it really easy to move the mouse precisely vertically, in line with the lines of the texture.I hope this helps someone who is on the edge about whether to buy this or not. Thank you, seller!-----------UPDATE: After using this laptop for a couple of weeks, I thought I should add an update. I do wish the display was a bit better. The colors wash out easily, especially at lower levels.It's also worth noting that the processor on this model is not listed as compatible for the Windows 11 upgrade. Not a big deal to me, but worth noting.",Wow. Just wow.,2021-07-13,5.0,R320K5CB86S5WV,Tyler ,11.0,"I received this machine on 12/4/22. The shipping was delayed but nothing too extreme. The first problem I noticed is the Touch Pad. I am unable to use two fingers and scroll up and down on a page. This machine was purchased for my company and we found this issue a major problem in our operations. However, I said ""It's fine, we will work around it and use a mouse"". That went alright for the first 10 minutes until I found that some of the keys aren't functioning the way they should be. This includes the brightness of the screen (bright and dim) seems to refresh and tab through sections vs lowering and raising the brightness. The other function that doesn't work is the volume buttons ( again, up and down ). This became frustrating quite quickly. Again, I said we will work around this issue. The final straw was when we were setting up the laptop. We found that we couldn't install drivers for the touch pad because they are not available. Also, we are not able to use the finger print feature to unlock the computer. Again, we are not able to install drivers because they are not available. At the end of the day, we have decided to move forward with a return and refund.PLEASE BE AWARE******THIS IS NOT A BAD LAPTOP. For the price, this laptop is exceptional. It will get the job done if you plan to use a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse. With the occasional ""laptop"" setting. I am still able to function with added steps but it becomes frustrating as I operate on other laptops that function the way that I want them too. Please do not be afraid to purchase this laptop as renewed because it is exactly that. I am still able to do all the functions of my job as needed but takes different steps. IT WILL GET THE JOB DONE.So please keep that in mind.",PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW. Good laptop,2022-12-05,3.0

I called Acer support they told me you have to click the charger in till you hear 2 clicks and not 1 which I felt like should have been stated in the instructions somewhere or something. Fast forward 3 days later I turned my computer on and it was just at a black screen nothing was happening. Turned it off then back on black screen still present. Called Acer support told them that after the computer tried to up date and next day I turned it on that was present they walked me through so steps to reset the software and 5 minutes later it was running again. To say the least it’s fast it plays Fortnite really well with no issues and few other games I play. The downside to this PC is all the bloatware I tried deleting the bloatware some won’t let me delete and the others I click delete and it freezes up on the task.

Do not expect it to run the latest games or any graphically intensive applications.  With that stated, I am utilizing these at a non profit charity that which mostly utilizes cloud based applications.  These computers work very well at this task while providing the future proofing of being Windows 11 compliant.We are replacing ACER Aspire E15 series laptops with this model.  The E15s were mostly generation 7 & 8 I3 and i5 models with SATA III SSDs and 8GB of RAM.  The NVMe drives are much faster than the older SATA III drives.  I miss the extra RAM, but not enough to crack open these cases for upgrades.  My volunteers appreciate the lighter weight and slimmer size.  I don't remember the last time we actually utilized an optical drive or card reader which were lost with the slimmer case.These have smaller batteries than our older models.  That coupled with the CPU and RAM workload increase, means that I anticipate 5 - 6 hours of battery life utilizing basic cloud based applications.  Streaming movies or playing basic games will decrease the life more.  Non CPU intensive desktop productivity software should increase the battery life.  The power port is proprietary so you will need to carry the brick and cords if you need more battery life during your day.  From an IT prospective, this is a blessing due to the number of infected USB C chargers that have begun popping up in public spaces.Most of the volunteers in the organization are older and greatly appreciate the larger display size.  There is no touch display option.  The maximum resolution is 1920x1080, but the overall quality does not keep up with mid level or elite laptops.  The viewing angle is about 120 degrees from the side and less from the top.  Graphics performance is low.  The colors are not as rich and the contrast is not as dynamic as better displays.  This does include HDMI 2.0.  I do not think it could drive a display with higher resolution very well though.  It is fine for plugging presentations in to a projector or large display.  I do not see much improvement on this display vs the 2017 - 2019 ACER E15 series laptops these are replacing.The webcam is basic.  The speakers are small and face down.  There is a single microphone.  If you speak on calls, a headset is a must.  If you listen on calls, this is adequate provided your space is quiet enough for the small speakers.  The overall sound quality is a compromise between value and quality leaning heavily on value.The keyboard is textured.  It is not backlit.  There is not indication that Caps lock or Number Lock are engaged.  So far, I prefer it to the usual flat chiclet keyboards that haunt modern laptops.  The key response is good.  The number pad keys are smaller than the regular keys and some of the buttons are not in standard 10 key locations.  The keyboard also does not use the standard inverted T for the arrow keys.  This is either a learning curve or an annoyance depending on the user.  Time will tell regarding dust and foreign debris issues and how difficult it is to change a key, switch or the entire keyboard.The touchpad is large enough to cover the display area adequately.  It is sensitive enough to cover tap clicking or actual clicking depending on user preference.  I do miss the button that disables the touchpad to eliminate palm pressing, but that disappeared with optical drives on every computer.The ports are great.  This laptop has  2 USB 3.2 and one USB C on the left side, and one USB 2.0 on the right side.  It also has gigabit ethernet and HDMI 2.0 on the left side and a headphone port on the right side.  The SD card reader has disappeared to no big loss.  Many of my volunteers prefer corded mice and happen to be right handed.  A USB port on the right side is really nice.  The power port is proprietary since this is USB C instead of Thunderbolt 3/4.  That is a nice range of current and future connectivity.  The average user will not need to utilize a dock or USB hub with this laptop.The WI-FI supports both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz protocols.  It maxes out at WI-FI 5 speeds.  The built in ethernet port is gigabit which maxes out at 125mbps.  Both are adequate for streaming, web browsing, email, and basic Internet use.  Most home networks are gigabit so this slots in very well.  I was able to maintain transfers at 2.3GBe with a USB 3.2 to 2.5GBe adapter.  There is no wireless upgrade option.You can access the main board and components with nothing more than a 00 Phillips screwdriver.  There is a single RAM slot and it utilizes NVMe 3.0.  The base model is a little light on both RAM and storage, but for a workstation, it is adequate.  For a more power user, you can upgrade both, which is nice and becoming rare in most laptops.  The NVMe drive is not heat shielded nor is it installed in a place with good airflow.  I would not be surprised to encounter heat throttling during periods of heavy use.  The overall drive life may be compromised as well.  Time will tell.  There are no additional unused SATA, PCI, or NVMe ports for expansion.  You cannot upgrade the CPU and there is no expansion port to add discrete graphics.  No surprise there.I immediately exited Windows S mode during initial setup.  Any program that won't allow a user to even utilize a different browser, isn't right for me.  This may be nice if you are attempting to keep users away from applications and websites of questionable origin but our desktop software will never be listed in the MS store and our cloud based software is not stable in Edge.The bottom line is that this laptop is designed for non power users and companies looking for a laptop that is more powerful and less controlled than the average Chromebook.  If your user experience is surfing the Internet, streaming videos, checking email, and running software that will never be listed in an App Store, this is a great option.  If you want to play games, or edit video or graphics, this is not the right choice for you.  Based on previous ACER experience, we anticipate 5 years of service out of these which is a great return of investment.",Not a powerhouse but acceptable for low end workstation use,2023-04-09,4.0,R2PYXX8IEARFZ4,Klaymate,223.0,"If I thought anyone would read the one to two star reviews, that's more likely what I would have rated this product. The laptop itself is fine but the operating system experience is really the part that makes me regret my purchase.For context my wife owns a slightly earlier model of this laptop and it seemed decent so I purchased the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-53S3 model. I opted to spring for the model with a decent graphics card (Iris XE) and larger solid state drive(storage) because my intent was to use this to play low end/low effort games on the couch while the kiddo and wife watched shows or movies. Even though it suffers from a shortage of RAM, it does seem like it will serve the purpose however I am disappointed with the user experience overall.Straight to the point: Windows 11 is awful. My wife's laptop came with windows 10, I helped her set it up and customize it the way she likes it. The laptop I just purchased came with windows 11 and it is an entirely different story. The initial setup alone was exhausting with multiple attempts by Microsoft to get me to agree to letting them track everything I do, including specific text regarding logging everything I type as well as my browser history and web interactions. They also attempt to sell you Microsoft services right off the bat in the form of free trial periods for 365, their cloud services and more. A few of them even note ""credit card required"" next to the automatically checked box if you wanted to continue. To me this felt pretty crummy. I just bought a 500 dollar laptop and they are already trying to get more money out of me before I even finish the initial setup. Acer adds to the issue by also offering deals, software and registering the product in exchange for services I have absolutely no interest in.It would be alright if it stopped there but unfortunately that is only the beginning of my disdain. I have only had the laptop for about 19 days and yet it seems like every other time I boot up the system something new pops up. The first few times it was programs installing themselves and congratulating me on my newly unrequested/not permitted acquisitions. Acer took it upon themselves to load Norton Antivirus on my system well after I finished the initial setup process. Icons for Amazon web games are created and appear in my start bar/menu randomly. I've deleted the Microsoft edge browser icon off my desktop and start bar and yet it continues to reappear. Its asked to update 3 times in the 19 days that I've owned it. It seems like one of out every 3 times I start the system it seems slow and sluggish to fully load windows only to find out something has been added without my consent. Which is especially anoying seeing that the system already comes with tons of applications pre loaded similar to buying a new smart phone. Tiktok, messanger apps, amazon prime, Disney+ and more, perhaps Im getting old but I would much rather install what I want myself then have to uninstall tons of apps I will never use from the system.As stated before there is not much RAM, even on the higher end model I purchased. Checking the performance page in task manager you can see that even without any other self installed apps running, windows and Acer's apps consume 4 of the 8 GB of system RAM. Uninstalling and shutting down a bunch of truly unessential apps and services I was able to get it down to 3/8 GB. The 256GB SSD is also already partially consumed by windows itself which no amount of uninstalling pre loaded apps seems to resolve.It does have enough resources to play games including some older titles that have 3D graphic requirements. I have not tried to play modern titles or expect it to play more graphic intensive titles but 3D style graphic MMORPGs, Adventure games and the like run pretty well. It does seem to have some issues playing intros and cut scenes sometimes and most annoying is the fact that letting the laptop go to sleep by inactivity or closing the lid causes most games to either crash outright or become slow and consistently stutter to the point where you have to close and reopen the application to resolve the issue.Battery life is about where I would expect it. Playing graphic games seems to drain it pretty quick. 90% to 40% in about 2 hours of running a low end games. It will last a short flight or a long movie but I expect to have to have it plugged in when ever I wanna really sink into playing something. Speakers are good enough as I wouldn't expect anything great out of a compact laptop. Screen looks crisp and bright.I cannot say I will likely return the laptop just based on the fact that almost all other laptops available at this point will will also have Windows 11 installed. Its not really an issue with the hardware as much as it's just the operating system that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't feel like its my personal computer. It feels more like a smart phone. I am having less and less faith the system will stay how I left it. The updates are forced and can only be put off for a max of 3 weeks. Gone are the days of getting a system how you like it and it staying that way. Here to stay is the age of only partial owning your system, being subjected to constant updates and with that the assumption its going to run worse and worse over time, plus always having some new unwanted surprise in store every time it is powered up.",Pretty disappointing,2023-01-04,3.0

You can throw a lot at it and it won't budge, however, do be mindful that this is still a laptop.  Cooling will be the primary issue as is the case with most other laptops.The good- The version I received came with a 10 core 12th gen i7, a dedicated 4050 GPU with 6GB of VRAM.  This is more than sufficient for my gaming, photoshop, programming, and productions needs.  I debated splurging on a laptop with a larger 17"" screen, for my purposes though 15"" is enough.  The brightness and clarity are great.  144Hz is an excellent feature, but considering the nature of this machine I would prefer 120Hz.  Allow me to clarify, I understand Hz has everything to do with the screen refresh rate.  I also understand most games can be capped around 120FPS, by capping the two it can allow cooling headroom.The mediocre- at $1K is 512GB of SSD space the best you can really do?  I immediately took my machine apart and installed an aftermarket 4TB crucial NVMe and a 4TB Samsung 980 Evo, in addition to replacing the RAM from 16GB to 64GB.  I understand this sounds like overkill, and it is... to an extent.  Beyond gaming I run virtualization software and edit photography shots for my side gig.  Running virtualized labs exhausts a lot of resources, and due to the nature of travel associated with my work, I can't always utilize my desktop.  Audio isn't the greatest on this machine either, the sounds are washed out due to the speakers being place on the bottom.The bad - expandability.  This is 2023, disk space should be expandable by now without voiding the warranty.  I am well aware I can purchase an external drive, but it blows my mind that modern day devices have the ability to be customized - e.g Disk space/RAM, etc, but the warranty must be void in order to do so.  These are relatively low risk modifications.The ugly- cooling, 100%.  MSI BIOS by default runs turbo, add Windows 11 to the mix and you have a deadly concoction on your hands.  This toasty boi almost peaked around 92C.  Yes, modern day equipment can run this hot, will it stand the test of time though?  I am not one to take that risk.  I managed to take 20C off of my average temps, which should hopefully increase the longevity of my laptop.What would my suggestion to the manufacturer be?- First and foremost disable turbo, it's unnecessary.  The laptop is certainly capable of performing under extreme workloads but it's not exactly practical when the temperature is teetering around it's throttle limit.- A thicker base for a more robust heatsink.  I know this is counterintuitive to the specific design of this product since it is supposed to be thing.  This could expand the life of the product though.Suggestions for the consumer- Turn off turbo in BIOS, it requires enabling advanced mode but the rewards are worth it.- Get rid of Windows 11, it's absolute garbage in its current state.  Maybe by the next iteration they will have fixed it.  For now, install Windows 10 via USB or install a user friendly Linux Distro like Mint, Debian, or Ubuntu.- Purchase an aftermarket laptop stand/cooler.  I don't have any particular one to suggest since I'm still in the search for something I think will perform the job correctly.Final thoughtsThis is a solid 7.5/10 laptop.  It's not bleeding edge by today's standards, but it will do more than just get you by especially if you are a student on a budget who enjoys games on the side.  This laptop also serves as a great multipurpose device with a few component modifications.  That all depends on if you are willing to risk voiding the warranty or not.  As an IT professional I suggest not doing so if you are not comfortable with the thought of that.","The good, the bad, and the ugly",2023-06-03,4.0,R2LET4Y973RTQB,Miao,0.0,"I received this 9/11, and start use it on 9/13 after re-installing the Microsoft system.

I opened it 9/12 and found the TouchPad is off, so I tried fn-f3 and re-installing the system. When I start again on 9/13, the TouchPad is still off. I also tried to install msi TouchPad drive and turn off the I2C HID in device management, but nothing changes.

So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick. Another drawback is that the pen or stylus was not included with it and is sold separately.There is no ethernet port and for those that want to utilize wired connections, will need to purchase an additional dongle.",Little on the heavy side but good otherwise,2023-07-21,4.0,R26JLCYDB9ADUG,Glen Jones,12.0,"So the computer itself looks nice.

I charge it to 100% and then shut it down and then the next day when I turned it on it was at 50%. It said I had 1 hour and 27 minutes left to the battery life. And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can’t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don’t really know who to trust.  So that’s kind of annoying.

While not a critical flaw, it's worth noting for potential buyers who value solid construction.Positive Aspects:Aside from the mentioned issues, there are several positive aspects to this laptop that I appreciate.

The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad... That's not a solution.I'm sure I'll be back with more to say but this was my immediate unhappy impressionnext day update: WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MENTION THAT ####### ### ###### ######## ###### LIGHT ON THE F6 KEY ????? It comes on when you push mute,,,,which, I ALWAYS have my computer on mute. I realise I could just turn down the volume but I want to push the mute button. And now when I do, this annoying orange light comes on that's a tiny sun in a dark room, very distracting. I hate it and now have put .99 cent nail polish on my 750$ machine.FEW DAYS LATER: the nail polish is holding up, but using this thing with only WoW running on it (that's it, that's all that on it) it's like being on the moores on a windy night.

I was looking for a replacement for a three year old model. A brand new version of what I got retails for around $1100. This refurbished unit was in perfect condition. It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value. Unless you're looking for the fastest gaming machine this will service any normal home or business user.","Excellent value for a fast and compact laptop, vendor rapidly fixed a problem!",2023-09-06,5.0,R3MSJUFKWY46D4,justreviewing,0.0,"Received this product today and cannot power it on.

There is a slot on the bottom that can be opened in order to access something under it but  I did not try to open or upgrade the item as the specifications on this were pretty strong on stock alone. That being said you should do your research before purchasing this. Based on the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do any upgrades if you are using it for basic use. This is by no means a gaming laptop and cannot handle games as much. This laptop overall is an average size laptop. It is relatively thin but not surface book thin. The specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is not too heavy and can fit in most laptop bags. It has a quad core celeron processor which is a very basic. The ram is 12 gb which is well over the standard 8 gb for most other lower end laptops. It will definitely work for most daily usage and a bit of heavy multitasking. That being said, it is okay in terms of battery life. It really only last about four  hours on average at most on a full charge. The cooling system is not too noisy on heavy usage. It is a standard charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future. The power brick is okay but it does take up the good amount of space if you happen to plug into a surge protector. Also it does not get hot during charging but do not leave it under a blanket or anything that can keep heat in. Upon boot up of the laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick with its 512 GB SSD. I am unsure if it is an SSD or M2 drive but it boots up pretty quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. You just need to make sure you have a microsoft account and such. It does run on windows 11 and I am unsure if you can do any downgrades if you like the other windows. The bloatware is not too terrible but I tend to remove those as much as possible. The laptop also has only a 15.6 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. This is a pretty standard laptop screen size. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best on the market. It still keep the traditional two 3.0 USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the dark silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. They do feel a bit cheap but they are responsive. It will work for me but I am unsure if the keys will fade over time. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. It is sealed inside a nice bag (not sure if it is antistatic) The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it but it does have a switch on the side to turn the camera on and off which is interesting and unique to this laptop. The microphone is okay but you can hear a bit of choppiness to voice. It does pick up some surrounding noise. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually make this laptop last longer than 4 hours. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but uninstall bloatware or whatever you do not need. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. Again this is not a gaming laptop as it does not have a powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer. The processor is a simple celeron laptop which is mostly for your daily use. The processing speed is decent and it works really well for say school work. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a decent for a home use laptop. You get an average size screen but this is not a gaming laptop. It can handle some light games but nothing intense. The laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is okay. The specification is not bad at 12 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what a student may need. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work or basic computer with a single monitor connection.

Mediocre gaming machine.,198.0,R389VS0DLFEXDM,5.0,Review from a non gamer user,58.0,R31FPYRL3G3L2G,5.0,Great entry level gaming laptop,5.0,R1KGQC8UBSP9TG,5.0,An Absolutely Amazing Laptop,1.0,R1ZP747Q489DTI,5.0,It’s been a while since I’ve given 5 stars: See Review,103.0,R1083B196FHTFL,Lee T.,198.0,"I bought this as a replacement for a Dell Inspiron that decided to abruptly fail.  I had been wanting to get a laptop that had a dedicated graphics card, a backlit keyboard, good system specs, upgradeability, at a good price.Throw in the fact that Asus includes one year of ACCIDENT PROTECTION, and this is a winner!!  While only having this laptop for a couple of days (Edit: Weeks now) now, I am so far, not disappointed with the purchase.  Here are my initial impressions, the pros and the cons.  Pros:  Audio:  The onboard speakers are quite adequate.  While not some of the ""loudest"" they are more than needed for watching youtube, hearing system alerts, recreational music,  video calls, stuff like that.  I have not yet tried the speakers while gaming.  [Edit] Ok these speakers are definitely high volume.  Watching youtube, I have the speakers at 50% and the audio of the video at 5% !  And I'm worried that the people across the hall might be kept awake while I insomnia the night away.  Also for the fact that these are laptop speakers, the quality is REALLY good.  I've been listening to MP3s on this machine and its been quite satisfactory.  I had a soundbar on my older ""gaming"" laptop, because the speakers were crap.  Definitely not the case here.  The screen:  The screen is very good resolution, quite bright, and very comfortable to read on.  Whether in regular daylight, a lit room, or in the dark.  I have not yet tested it as far as gaming.  CON:  This screen is SMALL.  Coming from laptops with 17.3"" screens, this is quite an adjustment.  The screen does have very small, thin bezels, so it does a good job giving you the most screen for footprint.  However, as somebody who does a lot of video and text editing, this is not what I would really want.  If I were working with 3d models, I would definitely want an external monitor or two.  It also does NOT fold flat.  This is no problem at all for me.  But for those that are looking for a device that will do so, this is not it.  [Edit]  Finding the settings to adjust saturation, color balance, stuff like that, I can't find it!  And when I'm editing images, this screen has a very high yellow saturation.  So unless I can find, or download something that will let me see colors the way their meant to be, and external monitor is going to another costly expenditure. (Edit: After a lot of web searching, I've fixed the problem with too much yellow saturation.  It's a windows 11 problem, not the machine.  Poorly implemented color scheme files by Microsoft in the windows 11)  Build Quality.  So far, this machine is quite sturdy.  The materials are good, and it doesn't feel like I am going to break it.  Or worry about having problems with it in my backpack.  Everything fits together very nicely.  Also when removing the bottom shell to get into the guts of the machine, I didn't feel like I was going to break it, or anything else, while using the spreader to pop the clips apart.  I do recommend the proper tool for the job tho.  Don't just try to jerk it apart after taking all those screws out.  Keyboard:  As with any new laptop, getting used to the key layout is almost always a chore.  There is no unified layout for the specialty keys.  For just typing, the layout is REALLY good.  The keys are spaced together Just Right, and doesn't cause me to make as many typos as my larger machines, where the keys are spaced further apart.  They are very tactile, and make very little noise.  They don't have the feel of mechanical keyswitches.  They may be membrane keys, or a combination.  [Edit]  Membrane keys.  I would rather have switches personally, as it's less to replace, if one key, or a couple of keys fail.  But they work really well in this machine.Other than when I have the machine sitting awkwardly on my lap, I have absolute NO problems typing on this, and can hit the keys that I'm aiming for quite intuitively, with very little in the way or typos induced by the machine.  The backlighting is GREAT.  I can very clearly see and read the keys in low, and no light.  I do wish that they could use combined colors, so that I could set one part of the keyboard to one color, and a different part to a different color.  Which really assists in gaming, using keyboard shortcuts.  But for me, that's not a dealbreaker.  I can read them in the dark, and that is what I was wanting.  The layout for the specialty keys is ""Fairly"" standard.  Tho the sleep mode key being on F11 and especially the airplane mode being on F12 is something that is not a wise choice as those are pretty common shortkeys for quite a few programs.  Mouse:  The mouse functioned quite well, right out of the box.  I do wish that it was set a bit further to the left, in an offset style.  As the butts of my thumbs do pass across the pad.  But for a laptop this size, you get what you get.  The cursor sweeps across the screen quite well, with minimal effort, right out of the box.  Big plus.  It also uses hardwared mouse buttons.  Not corner clicks on the mousepad.  Honestly, thats a HUGE win, IMO.  The corner click system I've never really liked, its an area that collects dust and crud, and has to be cleaned.  Whether this suits you or not, well, that's individual taste ;)CON: This mousepad collects oil.  It collects oil REALLY bad.  Weight:  This machine is VERY PORTABLE.  The weight is quite light.  I was actually very surprised when I opened the box.  I almost wondered if there was something missing.  Between the machine itself, and the power brick, this is QUITE light.  My Sager laptop is a brick.  The powerbrick is huge and weighs a ton.  This machine is most definitely a very welcomed upgrade from that!  Noise:  This machine really surprised me as far as the (lack of) noise from the fans.  I have had cooling pads with fans in them that have made more noise than the cooling system in  this machine!  ASUS has really outdone themselves with the cooling system.  Tho as stated, I haven't tried gaming on this thing yet.  But so far, the noise level from this is  quite pleasant, and very unobtrusive.  [Edit] Ok, so the fans have kicked on.  They are no means loud, compared to some of the other laptops that I have owned.  It's actually pretty subdued, for laptop fans.Somebody else had mentioned that they sound kind of like airplane turbines.  Yeah!  They actually kind of do! :D  Which is cool!  But again, they're fairly quiet.  I seriously doubt that they would bother anybody except for maybe a fairly light sleeper.  Heat:  Again, a very pleasant surprise!  I've run this machine a straight, solid 24 hours, and have not had the fans kick on high.  There is no hot air blowing out of the side ports, and it's extrememly comfortable on the lap.  (One of my HP laptops has literally left bald spots on my legs from the heat!)  Upgrades:  There are two slots for RAM.  Which are the standard open the clips, slide the new one in/out variety.  This makes upgrading the RAM very simple.  There are two slots for m2 type Solid State boards, which are spaced widely apart.  This is not only making it very easy for install/removal, but also for heat control.  Next to the battery, (NOT removable!) [Edit]  (The battery IS removable.  Just not externally like older laptops.  You have to open it up, disconnect it, and then it can be removed/swapped. )  There is a connector for a 2.5"" SATA drive.  Which included connectors.  I myself don't like the idea of putting a drive that close to the battery.  But considering how little this machine is, and how little space there is inside... it has to go somewhere, right?  And at least, we can add a 3rd drive!  Boot up:  With the operating system installed on a SSD, this machine boots up really fast.  Granted windows will really slow it down when it decides to do a mandatory update.  But without those, I press the power up button and within seconds, I'm typing in my password.  Very nice!  Edit 3/25/23:  After installing 32gb of ram, the first boot up was a tad slow as the BIOS updated to the new system specs.  However.  After that.  Oh lord!  I hit the power button and I could log into the machine almost instantly.  Speed:  So far the processor/RAM/SSD combination is a winner.  Even Adobe Photoshop CS6 fires right up.  Haven't tried it with gaming so far, but so far, my intensive programs aren't suffering any kind of slow-down, stuttering, or lag.  The exception to this is my browser.  I run A LOT OF TABS when I am surfing.  And browsers are heavy RAM hogs.  Yeah, one of my browsers is getting a lot of hesitation.  But that will go away when I upgrade RAM.  Edit 3/25/23:  I've just installed 32gb of T-Force Zeus DDR4  3200 CL-22 Memory to the machine.  It was super easy as far as the computer was concerned.  The packaging for the memory gave me more trouble than putting it into the laptop, LOL.  But then, I'm also a computer technician, so your mileage may very depending on your experience level.  The machine now boots up at 9% memory usage.  The clockspeed is reporting at 2933.  This is not a defect in the laptop.  This is the BIOS not automatically being set to run memory at higher speeds.  You can look up the instructions of how to do this online.  It takes a few minutes.  But do so on another machine, as you will need to be able to read the instructions while this laptop boots up.  Look up ""How to enable XMP to run your RAM at full speed"".CONS  Size:  As I said before, this is a very small, portable machine.  In that aspect it is fantastic!  However.  The palm rest is small enough that if you use an external mouse  there is VERY little room on the palmrest to put a mouse on it, much less use it.  I am constantly running the mouse over the arrow keys and part of the numpad.  This has caused me problems as those keys interact with programs, when I don't want them to!  This for me, is a huge con, as I really do use a laptop ON my LAP.  The screen is also small.  While I don't have very good eyes anymore, it's clear and easy to read.  But for some of the applications that I use my machines for, a larger, external monitor is going to be a must.  Windows 11:  This is a personal choice.  I myself believe that Microsoft went in a very, very bad direction with the latest release of their OS.  I will be backtracking the Operating System on this machine backwards to Windows 10 at the very first opportunity.  [Edit]  I really do hate this operating system.  The look of it is similar, but much different in ways that I don't like.  I also do not like the way that MS did the new taskbar.  The right click context menus are also way, way different, and very much not to my liking. [Edit] I found how to revert the context menus, looking around on the web.Especially since the changes that they made to the right click context menus are NOT compatible with a lot of the software that I use.  Disassembly:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  Taking this machine apart to get to the guts is actually really simple.  There are 11 screws holding the plate underneath to  the machine.  They are easy to take out, and the plate is fairly easy to remove.  HOWEVER.  These screws are all different lengths!  So you HAVE to keep track of which one goes where!  NON-Removable  External battery:  This is an obvious con.  Not only can you not carry around a spare, but you cannot easily replace the existing one, if it goes bad. [Edit] As I noted before, yeah the battery can be replaced, but you have to open up the lower shell.  It's not a hot swappable battery that we got used to on older machines.  RAM slots.  Ok, this was a huge let down for me.  I was planning to simply take out the RAM from the machine that died, and put it in here to upgrade the low 8gb of ram that  it comes with.  It doesn't FIT!!  The pin arrangement is different, and the slot in the board is spaced further to the left.  I will have to look up what RAM this thing takes and purchase new boards to perform the upgrade.HOWEVER.  And this... this is awesome.  There's only ONE 8gb stick in this machine, when it arrived.  NOT paired 2x 4gb sticks.  What that means is that I can just throw another 8gb stick in here, and double the memory.  Without having to sacrifice a stick that was already in it.  Because it wasn't already in it!  Or, I could just throw in a single 16gb stick and instantly TRIPLE the ram, at significantly less coss.  I'm reading conflicting information about how much this machine supports.  Most say it's 32gb, while some say 64gb.I am more inclined to believe 32, but I don't know for sure.  Expansion slots:  Pretty much all of the connectors for USB, Video Out, and audio are all on the left side.  This, since an external monitor is going to be a must, will cause  some arrangement problems.  It could cause problems for people that also will be using this on a desk.  One thing that I love about my older Dell laptops is that they have some  of the afore mentioned ports at the BACK of the machine.  Or at the Rear Corners.  More USB ports would also be a very nice addition.  No Optical Drive.  Maybe I'm just a dinosaur, but I do miss having an optical drive bay.  Being able to watch DVDs or burn disk was a habit from way back in the day.  Or just taking the tray out, and swapping in a 2.5 sata drive through an adapter was also a very seriously nice option.  Ahhhh, progress LOL.  8 Gb of ram:  This combined with Win11, the LOAD of software marked with ASUS, and that crapware McCaffee pre-installed...  the machine is running at around 50% memory usage.  The Asus Monitoring software, along with the bloated goat OS is taking up quite bit of the system memory.  After uninstalling worthless McCaffee, I've cut it down to about 40% with 8gb RAM.  And as stated above, this machine takes different RAM boards than those used by machines from a few years ago.  512 GB Solid State Storage:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  512 is quite good, in comparison to what similar machines are offering, which is half that.  At the same  pricepoint as these machines.  And as mentioned above, the machine will support up to 1tb storage boards, or SATA drive.  So there is definitely room for expansion with this machine.  However, to do so, IS an added expense.  And if you are planning on adding on a lot of games to this, you are definitely going to want to expand on the storage capacity!  Fortunately, it does have a sata slot.  Which means that you can add in a 1tb sata drive for considerably less money.Overall, the only thing that I'm going to complain about, is the size of the palm rests.  It's very comfortable for typing on.  But, as most of the applications that I use, I need those concise, accurate mouse movements.  And not having room to use a mouse on this machine is going to be a problem.That, and having to purchase windows 10 and what I will have to go through reinstalling drivers.  But again, that's a personal choice.",A great portable machine for daily use.  Mediocre gaming machine.,2022-12-18,5.0,R31WZZJHAD6UJ6,RSP,3.0,"So until the 13th generation of Intel CPU, the I series CPUs supported both EFI and bios legacy OS installation and booting yet this laptop has had that option removed. There is also no way to disable TPM which means Windows 11 just gets to install itself whenever it wants and you don't get a choice unless you want to solo boot Linux. Oh and you wanted to do a uefi/legacy bios Windows Linux dual boot so that they don't cross contaminate? F*** you says Asus, because as I previously mentioned that's not an option because they removed it. Also if you bought this laptop because of its promises to be easy to upgrade, it wasn't offensively bad but it has no right marketing itself that way, it was still fairly annoying to get the back plate off. As another note they used multiple different sizes of screw to hold in the back plate and only one of them is captive... Dell latitude e6410 from 2011 had only three screws of the same size and one of them was captive. I won't ask to return it unless something seriously bad goes wrong but my first day impressions are pretty bad. Oh also Aunt asus's website they will tell you that this laptop only supports 32 GB of RAM but I currently have 64 GB of RAM on it and it registers all of it... You can tell from Windows task Manager that they artificially make it so you can't access two of the ram slots it was supposed to have as well so they further undermine the theme of upgradability. It does come with the gddr6 1650, and to this device is credit when I put it through hell playing about 10 hours of video games yesterday, it kept the GPU very cool, however the laptop's underside got almost certainly OSHA violation level of hot, so under no circumstances should you buy this for business usage.Ultimately it did however over perform benchmarks I had seen previously on YouTube in Halo infinite and the performance was not bad. I will say with all of this bad it is still the best asus product I have used thus far, I will update this review again if that changes.",Very Underwhelming and it has the worst UEFI/BIOS I have ever interacted with,2023-02-11,3.0

You never know if you're going to get a hidden gem or an incompetently rebuilt piece of garbage. I have bought about a dozen of them, and promptly returned just more than half.This laptop is by far the most completely refurbed PC I have purchased. It looks new--the screen, the body, even the touchpad (which almost always shows wear) look untouched. It is definitely the nicest laptop I've had. The specs are exactly as listed, down to DDR4 memory and a battery that shows only 24 previous discharge/recharge cycles, far better than most refurbs.A word of advice for purchasers trying to figure out if a purchased refurb will work for them: -Don't expect anything to work well right out of the box. You will have to spend some time getting it in running order. Think of your time spent as balancing the $ you saved buying refurbished! (No, this isn't because the refurbisher didn't do their job. Once they get everything working, they will only do a clean install of Windows. The rest is up to you, just like it would be with a new computer.) -The first thing any Windows machine when you finish the guided set up (IF you connected to a wifi or wired network) is start installing Windows updates. (You can check progress by selecting ""Check for updates"" from the start menu.) Until all updates are finished, it will be slow. It might even restart seemingly at random. Once you think all updates are installed, reboot and check for updates until it shows ""You're up to date"". This can take quite some time with a slow network connection, so be sure you're using fast wifi or even plug in an ethernet cable until ALL updates are done. -While updates are installing, check the specs to make sure they are what you bought. Don't assume. The built-in Windows System Information app is a good place to start. There are lots of free apps for reporting on the HDD, memory, and battery. Check Google. If ANYTHING seems off, ask the seller about it. If you don't like the answer, return it! -Next go to the manufacturer's support website and install all available driver updates (including BIOS!). I can't oversell the importance here. Many manufacturers have an app you can download to streamline this process (for HP it is HP Support Assistant). NOTE: If something stops working during this step (function keys or bluetooth are the most likely things to stop working), Google away until you find a solution. Someone has run into the same problem before, and the solution is probably there to be found. -After these steps, you should have a fully functional computer. Test it out and see if it actually meets your needs. If not, contact the seller. If you aren't happy with the response, return it!One word of warning: the touchpad is textured. I can see this bothering some people, but I kind of like it. It makes it really easy to move the mouse precisely vertically, in line with the lines of the texture.I hope this helps someone who is on the edge about whether to buy this or not. Thank you, seller!-----------UPDATE: After using this laptop for a couple of weeks, I thought I should add an update. I do wish the display was a bit better. The colors wash out easily, especially at lower levels.It's also worth noting that the processor on this model is not listed as compatible for the Windows 11 upgrade. Not a big deal to me, but worth noting.",Wow. Just wow.,2021-07-13,5.0,R320K5CB86S5WV,Tyler ,11.0,"I received this machine on 12/4/22. The shipping was delayed but nothing too extreme. The first problem I noticed is the Touch Pad. I am unable to use two fingers and scroll up and down on a page. This machine was purchased for my company and we found this issue a major problem in our operations. However, I said ""It's fine, we will work around it and use a mouse"". That went alright for the first 10 minutes until I found that some of the keys aren't functioning the way they should be. This includes the brightness of the screen (bright and dim) seems to refresh and tab through sections vs lowering and raising the brightness. The other function that doesn't work is the volume buttons ( again, up and down ). This became frustrating quite quickly. Again, I said we will work around this issue. The final straw was when we were setting up the laptop. We found that we couldn't install drivers for the touch pad because they are not available. Also, we are not able to use the finger print feature to unlock the computer. Again, we are not able to install drivers because they are not available. At the end of the day, we have decided to move forward with a return and refund.PLEASE BE AWARE******THIS IS NOT A BAD LAPTOP. For the price, this laptop is exceptional. It will get the job done if you plan to use a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse. With the occasional ""laptop"" setting. I am still able to function with added steps but it becomes frustrating as I operate on other laptops that function the way that I want them too. Please do not be afraid to purchase this laptop as renewed because it is exactly that. I am still able to do all the functions of my job as needed but takes different steps. IT WILL GET THE JOB DONE.So please keep that in mind.",PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW. Good laptop,2022-12-05,3.0

I called Acer support they told me you have to click the charger in till you hear 2 clicks and not 1 which I felt like should have been stated in the instructions somewhere or something. Fast forward 3 days later I turned my computer on and it was just at a black screen nothing was happening. Turned it off then back on black screen still present. Called Acer support told them that after the computer tried to up date and next day I turned it on that was present they walked me through so steps to reset the software and 5 minutes later it was running again. To say the least it’s fast it plays Fortnite really well with no issues and few other games I play. The downside to this PC is all the bloatware I tried deleting the bloatware some won’t let me delete and the others I click delete and it freezes up on the task.

Do not expect it to run the latest games or any graphically intensive applications.  With that stated, I am utilizing these at a non profit charity that which mostly utilizes cloud based applications.  These computers work very well at this task while providing the future proofing of being Windows 11 compliant.We are replacing ACER Aspire E15 series laptops with this model.  The E15s were mostly generation 7 & 8 I3 and i5 models with SATA III SSDs and 8GB of RAM.  The NVMe drives are much faster than the older SATA III drives.  I miss the extra RAM, but not enough to crack open these cases for upgrades.  My volunteers appreciate the lighter weight and slimmer size.  I don't remember the last time we actually utilized an optical drive or card reader which were lost with the slimmer case.These have smaller batteries than our older models.  That coupled with the CPU and RAM workload increase, means that I anticipate 5 - 6 hours of battery life utilizing basic cloud based applications.  Streaming movies or playing basic games will decrease the life more.  Non CPU intensive desktop productivity software should increase the battery life.  The power port is proprietary so you will need to carry the brick and cords if you need more battery life during your day.  From an IT prospective, this is a blessing due to the number of infected USB C chargers that have begun popping up in public spaces.Most of the volunteers in the organization are older and greatly appreciate the larger display size.  There is no touch display option.  The maximum resolution is 1920x1080, but the overall quality does not keep up with mid level or elite laptops.  The viewing angle is about 120 degrees from the side and less from the top.  Graphics performance is low.  The colors are not as rich and the contrast is not as dynamic as better displays.  This does include HDMI 2.0.  I do not think it could drive a display with higher resolution very well though.  It is fine for plugging presentations in to a projector or large display.  I do not see much improvement on this display vs the 2017 - 2019 ACER E15 series laptops these are replacing.The webcam is basic.  The speakers are small and face down.  There is a single microphone.  If you speak on calls, a headset is a must.  If you listen on calls, this is adequate provided your space is quiet enough for the small speakers.  The overall sound quality is a compromise between value and quality leaning heavily on value.The keyboard is textured.  It is not backlit.  There is not indication that Caps lock or Number Lock are engaged.  So far, I prefer it to the usual flat chiclet keyboards that haunt modern laptops.  The key response is good.  The number pad keys are smaller than the regular keys and some of the buttons are not in standard 10 key locations.  The keyboard also does not use the standard inverted T for the arrow keys.  This is either a learning curve or an annoyance depending on the user.  Time will tell regarding dust and foreign debris issues and how difficult it is to change a key, switch or the entire keyboard.The touchpad is large enough to cover the display area adequately.  It is sensitive enough to cover tap clicking or actual clicking depending on user preference.  I do miss the button that disables the touchpad to eliminate palm pressing, but that disappeared with optical drives on every computer.The ports are great.  This laptop has  2 USB 3.2 and one USB C on the left side, and one USB 2.0 on the right side.  It also has gigabit ethernet and HDMI 2.0 on the left side and a headphone port on the right side.  The SD card reader has disappeared to no big loss.  Many of my volunteers prefer corded mice and happen to be right handed.  A USB port on the right side is really nice.  The power port is proprietary since this is USB C instead of Thunderbolt 3/4.  That is a nice range of current and future connectivity.  The average user will not need to utilize a dock or USB hub with this laptop.The WI-FI supports both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz protocols.  It maxes out at WI-FI 5 speeds.  The built in ethernet port is gigabit which maxes out at 125mbps.  Both are adequate for streaming, web browsing, email, and basic Internet use.  Most home networks are gigabit so this slots in very well.  I was able to maintain transfers at 2.3GBe with a USB 3.2 to 2.5GBe adapter.  There is no wireless upgrade option.You can access the main board and components with nothing more than a 00 Phillips screwdriver.  There is a single RAM slot and it utilizes NVMe 3.0.  The base model is a little light on both RAM and storage, but for a workstation, it is adequate.  For a more power user, you can upgrade both, which is nice and becoming rare in most laptops.  The NVMe drive is not heat shielded nor is it installed in a place with good airflow.  I would not be surprised to encounter heat throttling during periods of heavy use.  The overall drive life may be compromised as well.  Time will tell.  There are no additional unused SATA, PCI, or NVMe ports for expansion.  You cannot upgrade the CPU and there is no expansion port to add discrete graphics.  No surprise there.I immediately exited Windows S mode during initial setup.  Any program that won't allow a user to even utilize a different browser, isn't right for me.  This may be nice if you are attempting to keep users away from applications and websites of questionable origin but our desktop software will never be listed in the MS store and our cloud based software is not stable in Edge.The bottom line is that this laptop is designed for non power users and companies looking for a laptop that is more powerful and less controlled than the average Chromebook.  If your user experience is surfing the Internet, streaming videos, checking email, and running software that will never be listed in an App Store, this is a great option.  If you want to play games, or edit video or graphics, this is not the right choice for you.  Based on previous ACER experience, we anticipate 5 years of service out of these which is a great return of investment.",Not a powerhouse but acceptable for low end workstation use,2023-04-09,4.0,R2PYXX8IEARFZ4,Klaymate,223.0,"If I thought anyone would read the one to two star reviews, that's more likely what I would have rated this product. The laptop itself is fine but the operating system experience is really the part that makes me regret my purchase.For context my wife owns a slightly earlier model of this laptop and it seemed decent so I purchased the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-53S3 model. I opted to spring for the model with a decent graphics card (Iris XE) and larger solid state drive(storage) because my intent was to use this to play low end/low effort games on the couch while the kiddo and wife watched shows or movies. Even though it suffers from a shortage of RAM, it does seem like it will serve the purpose however I am disappointed with the user experience overall.Straight to the point: Windows 11 is awful. My wife's laptop came with windows 10, I helped her set it up and customize it the way she likes it. The laptop I just purchased came with windows 11 and it is an entirely different story. The initial setup alone was exhausting with multiple attempts by Microsoft to get me to agree to letting them track everything I do, including specific text regarding logging everything I type as well as my browser history and web interactions. They also attempt to sell you Microsoft services right off the bat in the form of free trial periods for 365, their cloud services and more. A few of them even note ""credit card required"" next to the automatically checked box if you wanted to continue. To me this felt pretty crummy. I just bought a 500 dollar laptop and they are already trying to get more money out of me before I even finish the initial setup. Acer adds to the issue by also offering deals, software and registering the product in exchange for services I have absolutely no interest in.It would be alright if it stopped there but unfortunately that is only the beginning of my disdain. I have only had the laptop for about 19 days and yet it seems like every other time I boot up the system something new pops up. The first few times it was programs installing themselves and congratulating me on my newly unrequested/not permitted acquisitions. Acer took it upon themselves to load Norton Antivirus on my system well after I finished the initial setup process. Icons for Amazon web games are created and appear in my start bar/menu randomly. I've deleted the Microsoft edge browser icon off my desktop and start bar and yet it continues to reappear. Its asked to update 3 times in the 19 days that I've owned it. It seems like one of out every 3 times I start the system it seems slow and sluggish to fully load windows only to find out something has been added without my consent. Which is especially anoying seeing that the system already comes with tons of applications pre loaded similar to buying a new smart phone. Tiktok, messanger apps, amazon prime, Disney+ and more, perhaps Im getting old but I would much rather install what I want myself then have to uninstall tons of apps I will never use from the system.As stated before there is not much RAM, even on the higher end model I purchased. Checking the performance page in task manager you can see that even without any other self installed apps running, windows and Acer's apps consume 4 of the 8 GB of system RAM. Uninstalling and shutting down a bunch of truly unessential apps and services I was able to get it down to 3/8 GB. The 256GB SSD is also already partially consumed by windows itself which no amount of uninstalling pre loaded apps seems to resolve.It does have enough resources to play games including some older titles that have 3D graphic requirements. I have not tried to play modern titles or expect it to play more graphic intensive titles but 3D style graphic MMORPGs, Adventure games and the like run pretty well. It does seem to have some issues playing intros and cut scenes sometimes and most annoying is the fact that letting the laptop go to sleep by inactivity or closing the lid causes most games to either crash outright or become slow and consistently stutter to the point where you have to close and reopen the application to resolve the issue.Battery life is about where I would expect it. Playing graphic games seems to drain it pretty quick. 90% to 40% in about 2 hours of running a low end games. It will last a short flight or a long movie but I expect to have to have it plugged in when ever I wanna really sink into playing something. Speakers are good enough as I wouldn't expect anything great out of a compact laptop. Screen looks crisp and bright.I cannot say I will likely return the laptop just based on the fact that almost all other laptops available at this point will will also have Windows 11 installed. Its not really an issue with the hardware as much as it's just the operating system that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't feel like its my personal computer. It feels more like a smart phone. I am having less and less faith the system will stay how I left it. The updates are forced and can only be put off for a max of 3 weeks. Gone are the days of getting a system how you like it and it staying that way. Here to stay is the age of only partial owning your system, being subjected to constant updates and with that the assumption its going to run worse and worse over time, plus always having some new unwanted surprise in store every time it is powered up.",Pretty disappointing,2023-01-04,3.0

You can throw a lot at it and it won't budge, however, do be mindful that this is still a laptop.  Cooling will be the primary issue as is the case with most other laptops.The good- The version I received came with a 10 core 12th gen i7, a dedicated 4050 GPU with 6GB of VRAM.  This is more than sufficient for my gaming, photoshop, programming, and productions needs.  I debated splurging on a laptop with a larger 17"" screen, for my purposes though 15"" is enough.  The brightness and clarity are great.  144Hz is an excellent feature, but considering the nature of this machine I would prefer 120Hz.  Allow me to clarify, I understand Hz has everything to do with the screen refresh rate.  I also understand most games can be capped around 120FPS, by capping the two it can allow cooling headroom.The mediocre- at $1K is 512GB of SSD space the best you can really do?  I immediately took my machine apart and installed an aftermarket 4TB crucial NVMe and a 4TB Samsung 980 Evo, in addition to replacing the RAM from 16GB to 64GB.  I understand this sounds like overkill, and it is... to an extent.  Beyond gaming I run virtualization software and edit photography shots for my side gig.  Running virtualized labs exhausts a lot of resources, and due to the nature of travel associated with my work, I can't always utilize my desktop.  Audio isn't the greatest on this machine either, the sounds are washed out due to the speakers being place on the bottom.The bad - expandability.  This is 2023, disk space should be expandable by now without voiding the warranty.  I am well aware I can purchase an external drive, but it blows my mind that modern day devices have the ability to be customized - e.g Disk space/RAM, etc, but the warranty must be void in order to do so.  These are relatively low risk modifications.The ugly- cooling, 100%.  MSI BIOS by default runs turbo, add Windows 11 to the mix and you have a deadly concoction on your hands.  This toasty boi almost peaked around 92C.  Yes, modern day equipment can run this hot, will it stand the test of time though?  I am not one to take that risk.  I managed to take 20C off of my average temps, which should hopefully increase the longevity of my laptop.What would my suggestion to the manufacturer be?- First and foremost disable turbo, it's unnecessary.  The laptop is certainly capable of performing under extreme workloads but it's not exactly practical when the temperature is teetering around it's throttle limit.- A thicker base for a more robust heatsink.  I know this is counterintuitive to the specific design of this product since it is supposed to be thing.  This could expand the life of the product though.Suggestions for the consumer- Turn off turbo in BIOS, it requires enabling advanced mode but the rewards are worth it.- Get rid of Windows 11, it's absolute garbage in its current state.  Maybe by the next iteration they will have fixed it.  For now, install Windows 10 via USB or install a user friendly Linux Distro like Mint, Debian, or Ubuntu.- Purchase an aftermarket laptop stand/cooler.  I don't have any particular one to suggest since I'm still in the search for something I think will perform the job correctly.Final thoughtsThis is a solid 7.5/10 laptop.  It's not bleeding edge by today's standards, but it will do more than just get you by especially if you are a student on a budget who enjoys games on the side.  This laptop also serves as a great multipurpose device with a few component modifications.  That all depends on if you are willing to risk voiding the warranty or not.  As an IT professional I suggest not doing so if you are not comfortable with the thought of that.","The good, the bad, and the ugly",2023-06-03,4.0,R2LET4Y973RTQB,Miao,0.0,"I received this 9/11, and start use it on 9/13 after re-installing the Microsoft system.

I opened it 9/12 and found the TouchPad is off, so I tried fn-f3 and re-installing the system. When I start again on 9/13, the TouchPad is still off. I also tried to install msi TouchPad drive and turn off the I2C HID in device management, but nothing changes.

The 13th gen i7 chip feel like it can handle anything I throw at it, with good battery life, a beautiful screen, all the little features that make it easy to use.  The software tools to work seamlessly with my other Samsung devices are handy, too; I can wirelessly use my phone or tablet as a second display for the laptop, or just use the laptop's mouse and keyboard to interact with my phone and laptop. The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop. If that's the tradeoff for having a thin device with a lid that is going to stay securely closed, though, I'm good with it.Overall, it's a great laptop and I expect to be using it as a main device for many years.",Portable and Powerful,2023-08-22,5.0,R31BLNPXMW2N0P,Josef Farkas,33.0,"This is an interesting product: it has superb video and sound performance but the rest is just average. Here are some observations.The Pros: as mentioned earlier.The Cons: 1. The hardware details on the USB ports say that it is from the 2006 Specs! Wow!2. The Taskbar can only be partially expanded to the left, the hidden icons can't be dragged out.3. The laptop can't properly connect to a Samsung A53-5G phone nor to a Samsung  S6-Lite  Tablet. It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither. Sorry Samsung, I expect another take on the design of such laptops and hope to see a star performer having a competitive price.","Superb and Excellent Video and Sound, Average rest of the components and Performance.",2023-04-20,3.0

HP stated the reason Windows would not activate was that the seller did not use Genuine HP parts when they upgraded the laptop which flagged the system. It also voided the manufacturer's warranty on those specific parts. HP helped me solve the problem since they have 24/7 service,  and this was a Friday evening. I received instructions from the seller the following week on how to fix the problem which I had already corrected with HP's help.

I had been using an AMD 3200u for several years, but it was clearly showing its age. I was pleasantly surprised to come across this laptop with a 5625u at such an affordable price. The Geekbench scores are quite close to those of the 5600u.The first thing I did, and I highly recommend this to anyone else, is to add a 16GB (8GB works fine too) stick of 3200MHz RAM, bringing the laptop's total to 24GB. The improvement in performance with dual-channel memory is significant.What's most surprising is the battery life, considering the power and the large 17"" screen. While I can't provide exact numbers due to varying usage patterns, I can easily get several hours of work done before needing to recharge.The screen is decent for my needs—not outstanding, but far from terrible.Although I primarily purchased this laptop for work, I couldn't resist installing a few games out of curiosity. To my amazement, this little APU held its own. It can handle some older titles at high settings and even newer ones at lower settings. What surprised me the most was when I tried playing Doom Eternal. Running it at 720p on all low settings, the game was surprisingly playable. While I wouldn't recommend this laptop as a gaming PC, it's worth mentioning that it can handle older titles, emulations, or kids' games with ease.","Nothing is more powerful for the price, battery life is insane.",2023-09-11,5.0,R3ELWUII2ICCOI,Les,0.0,"These laptops are not able to be registered for warranty outside of the USA. Lanovo will only register these laptops in the USA. Unlike ThinkPads there is no IWS service warranty, so, no warranty for a brand new machine. A used like new ThinkPad is better than purchasing one of these laptops, you can purchase an extended warranty and IWS service is afforded for them. Much more machine for a lot less money if you shop around. Be careful though with the refurbished laptops, some may have low quality replacement parts and I do not know if you purchase the extended warranty if they will cover those parts. Still, much better to buy excellent quality refurbished. Just check with Lanovo online as soon as you receive that the serial number which is tied to the original motherboard is accepted on their system.When I first checked the warranty it showed as expired and I contacted Amazon because I thought it might have been used. Amazon assured me it was new and able to get a warranty. When I attempted to register for warranty is when I found out the ugly truth. No warranty out side of the US.When I contacted Amazon they did say I could return it, but they would not arrange for pickup return, they claimed they had no return shipping service for my area.I had to ship it back, paying from my own pocket the shipping fee. When I questioned about reimbursement for the shipping fees I did not get a clear commitment, just phrases like no worries we will “help” with the return shipping fees.I contacted Amazon several times after trying to be comfortable with returning the laptop without losing any money. Sorry, but the words they used were ambiguous to me. It was not worth returning the laptop if I am going to lose money on it.Shippers refused it because it has a lithium battery. FedEx accepted it, the cost is about $168 in USD. I informed Amazon and still heard “no worries”, just return it.They just did not seem to understand I did not want to return it if I was going to lose any money on it.The best I could understand from Amazon is my refund will be handled this way;Item cost and ship to cost after returned to the seller. Although the ad says fulfilled by and sold by Amazon, I was told by the last CSR that it was not sold by Amazon and had to be returned to the seller.I don’t know what is true.The import fees could take up to six months to be returned.How, when and if I get the return of the $168 cost to ship the laptop was basically left in the “No worries, just ship it back” column.  One suggestion by a CSR was a “promotion”, I told them a “promotion” was not helpful. Why should I be punished and forced to accept a “promotion” for that much money when it is Amazon that lacks the ability to arrange return shipping?I am taking the risk shipping it back to give Amazon a chance, but at this point I am afraid I am getting misled.Past experience with Amazon has been very good, but this and an order that is messed up placed after this have me really on edge.Right now I am out of pocket over $700 and unsure of if/when I will be made whole on the transaction.What good is “helping” me with a promotion when I may face another issue on a future order. I understand Amazon loses money on the situation. But I just want what was indicated I was paying for.I still see these laptops being sold internationally without informing that unlike Lanovo ThinkPads they are not eligible warranty registration out side of the US and do not have IWS warranty coverage.If Amazon is going to continue to sell these as New Lanovo Laptops internationally they should make it very clear that they are not eligible for warranty out side of the US.

So far I am overall happy with this unit. The screen quality is very good for a lower to mid budget laptop and colors are vibrant enough. Touchscreen works great as well. I like the idea of the flexibility of changing between laptop mode and tablet mode. The 16"" screen size in tablet mode is great for watching movies and other random entertaining things, but if your goal is to use it for note taking or similar, it is a little on the larger side and would recommend the 14"" instead.  My main purpose is to use it for travels and remote work via remote desktop, so the additional real estate on the screen was important for me for my engineering work (CAD and programming).Since I also have a need for multiple monitors when stationary, I went ahead and also purchased a cheap off-brand USB-C docking station from Falwedi on Amazon. I was able to expand to at least 2 additional monitors, resulting in a triple monitor setup, one 24"" Dell 1080 and another 27"" Dell 2K. I did however get some issues where the external monitors would blank for a second or two occasionally, but not yet sure if this was due to the current drivers on the Ideapad or the off-brand docking station. Something I will need to investigate further at a later time.Sound quality from the speakers is just ok. There is no base, which I wouldn't expect from a lower budget laptop anyways. The camera worked decently and clear, which is sufficient for most video conferences anyways.The fingerprint reader works flawlessly and makes login into Windows and other biometric supporting apps super easy.I am however surprised on how heavy this unit is for being a new modern 16"" model. Reminds me of my 10+ year old Toshiba brick.

I charge it to 100% and then shut it down and then the next day when I turned it on it was at 50%. It said I had 1 hour and 27 minutes left to the battery life. And I didn’t do anything overnight with, so I’m questioning where the power went to? So as I said, it has a fingerprint reader, but every time I turn it on spin, asking me to enter a pin number or password. If I have a fingerprint reader, that should be one of the options initially. I did set it up with my fingerprint before going through all that other things about the password. It’s a good enough computer. It just has some quirks. And all the time is asking me to put in a McAfee subscription or to buy one. I can’t tell you how many fake emails I get every day about some McAfee subscription or some Norton thing I don’t really know who to trust.  So that’s kind of annoying.

The 13th gen i7 chip feel like it can handle anything I throw at it, with good battery life, a beautiful screen, all the little features that make it easy to use.  The software tools to work seamlessly with my other Samsung devices are handy, too; I can wirelessly use my phone or tablet as a second display for the laptop, or just use the laptop's mouse and keyboard to interact with my phone and laptop. The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop.

The Taskbar can only be partially expanded to the left, the hidden icons can't be dragged out.3. The laptop can't properly connect to a Samsung A53-5G phone nor to a Samsung  S6-Lite  Tablet. It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither.

Although the product has some positive aspects, there are areas that require attention for a more satisfying user experience.CPU Performance and Chrome Usage:One significant concern is the laptop's CPU usage when running resource-intensive tasks, such as opening/closing applications and heavily utilizing Chrome browser. As a power user who frequently works with multiple Chrome windows open simultaneously, I noticed that the CPU operates at 100% capacity, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. For users with less demanding tasks, this may not be a problem, but if you require better CPU performance for your tasks, you might want to consider other options.Mousepad Sensitivity:Another minor issue I encountered is the mousepad sensitivity when holding the laptop with one hand. The mousepad tends to get stuck, which appears to be related to the material and design of the laptop. While not a critical flaw, it's worth noting for potential buyers who value solid construction.Positive Aspects:Aside from the mentioned issues, there are several positive aspects to this laptop that I appreciate. It boasts a sleek design and appears to be well-built, except for the mousepad issue.

It was supposed to have a fingerprint reader but I contacted the vendor and discovered that they had been misinformed. They rapidly rectified the issue in days with just a couple emails.The computer itself was clean, the display is delightfully clear and bright. The AMD Ryzen CPU is more than twice as fast as the machine it replaces. It has run everything I need with plenty of headroom (typically running less than 6% CPU. The NvME SSD is blazing fast.) The 16 gigabytes of RAM is provided by two SoDIMM which allows dual-channel, interleaved access making it even a little faster. I've used it on an external monitor and gotten great 4K results at 60 Hertz. This was a great bargain. Plus, the vendor support was excellent.I want to call out the specs on this again. AMD has an excellent line of CPUs and are comparable to Intel's latest generation. The construction of the ProBook follows the same frame design as the EliteBook which is the top of the line business machine, with fewer ports. It would be hard to match this for anywhere near this price. I've used other Amazon refurb products and been pleased at the value.

There is a slot on the bottom that can be opened in order to access something under it but  I did not try to open or upgrade the item as the specifications on this were pretty strong on stock alone. That being said you should do your research before purchasing this. Based on the current specification, I am sure you do not need to do any upgrades if you are using it for basic use. This is by no means a gaming laptop and cannot handle games as much. This laptop overall is an average size laptop. It is relatively thin but not surface book thin. The specification are not bad for what you get. This laptop is not too heavy and can fit in most laptop bags. It has a quad core celeron processor which is a very basic. The ram is 12 gb which is well over the standard 8 gb for most other lower end laptops. It will definitely work for most daily usage and a bit of heavy multitasking. That being said, it is okay in terms of battery life. It really only last about four  hours on average at most on a full charge. The cooling system is not too noisy on heavy usage. It is a standard charger which can make it a bit annoying to replace in the future. The power brick is okay but it does take up the good amount of space if you happen to plug into a surge protector. Also it does not get hot during charging but do not leave it under a blanket or anything that can keep heat in. Upon boot up of the laptop, the laptop boots up fairly quick with its 512 GB SSD. I am unsure if it is an SSD or M2 drive but it boots up pretty quick. The setup is pretty straight forward and does not require any driver installation. You just need to make sure you have a microsoft account and such. It does run on windows 11 and I am unsure if you can do any downgrades if you like the other windows. The bloatware is not too terrible but I tend to remove those as much as possible. The laptop also has only a 15.6 inch screen with the max resolution at 1920 x 1080. This is a pretty standard laptop screen size. The screen has an okay brightness but not the best on the market. It still keep the traditional two 3.0 USB port as well so you do not have to buy an adapter for this laptop while also having the type c (non thunderbolt) port. The laptop can be angled back for better viewing but it cannot be pushed back all the way. The laptop surface where the wrist rest is where I do not like the material. It looks nice with the dark silver but with long term use it will fade over time. The keys are okay, but not the best. They do feel a bit cheap but they are responsive. It will work for me but I am unsure if the keys will fade over time. The external casing of this surface is very easy to scratch (seems to be an issue with all this material) so I would recommend that you get a laptop case for it. It is sealed inside a nice bag (not sure if it is antistatic) The trackpad runs pretty well, It is sensitive and feels smooth to move across. It also does not look like it will wear down easily which is good. There is a camera that will record at at least 720p. You could put a web cam cover on it but it does have a switch on the side to turn the camera on and off which is interesting and unique to this laptop. The microphone is okay but you can hear a bit of choppiness to voice. It does pick up some surrounding noise. On laptop, there is a 3.5 port to plug in headphones/microphone. It does have dual band wifi built in and no issues with speed/connection. Depending on how much you have open and how much you utilize the laptop capability, you could actually make this laptop last longer than 4 hours. Best thing to do is just balance the resource as best you can. The overall charge time depends but it can take up to three to charge the laptop to 100% from what I can tell. It is not too long. It has a decent boot up being less than fifteen seconds to boot up but uninstall bloatware or whatever you do not need. The speaker system is pretty loud but they do have a bit of a feedback noise that is a bit annoying but that is okay. Again this is not a gaming laptop as it does not have a powerful card that allows you to game very well on this computer. The processor is a simple celeron laptop which is mostly for your daily use. The processing speed is decent and it works really well for say school work. There is an HDMI port so you are able to connect this to an external screen. I am unsure if there is a dock that is meant for this laptop. Overall this laptop is a decent for a home use laptop. You get an average size screen but this is not a gaming laptop. It can handle some light games but nothing intense. The laptop can run a bit hot and the battery life is okay. The specification is not bad at 12 GB ram and 512 gb SSD drive. The space is decent for what a student may need. It is good for all around use and can easily be made into a work or basic computer with a single monitor connection.

I had been wanting to get a laptop that had a dedicated graphics card, a backlit keyboard, good system specs, upgradeability, at a good price.Throw in the fact that Asus includes one year of ACCIDENT PROTECTION, and this is a winner!!  While only having this laptop for a couple of days (Edit: Weeks now) now, I am so far, not disappointed with the purchase.  Here are my initial impressions, the pros and the cons.  Pros:  Audio:  The onboard speakers are quite adequate.  While not some of the ""loudest"" they are more than needed for watching youtube, hearing system alerts, recreational music,  video calls, stuff like that.  I have not yet tried the speakers while gaming.  [Edit] Ok these speakers are definitely high volume.  Watching youtube, I have the speakers at 50% and the audio of the video at 5% !  And I'm worried that the people across the hall might be kept awake while I insomnia the night away.  Also for the fact that these are laptop speakers, the quality is REALLY good.  I've been listening to MP3s on this machine and its been quite satisfactory.  I had a soundbar on my older ""gaming"" laptop, because the speakers were crap.  Definitely not the case here.  The screen:  The screen is very good resolution, quite bright, and very comfortable to read on.  Whether in regular daylight, a lit room, or in the dark.  I have not yet tested it as far as gaming.  CON:  This screen is SMALL.  Coming from laptops with 17.3"" screens, this is quite an adjustment.  The screen does have very small, thin bezels, so it does a good job giving you the most screen for footprint.  However, as somebody who does a lot of video and text editing, this is not what I would really want.  If I were working with 3d models, I would definitely want an external monitor or two.  It also does NOT fold flat.  This is no problem at all for me.  But for those that are looking for a device that will do so, this is not it.  [Edit]  Finding the settings to adjust saturation, color balance, stuff like that, I can't find it!  And when I'm editing images, this screen has a very high yellow saturation.  So unless I can find, or download something that will let me see colors the way their meant to be, and external monitor is going to another costly expenditure. (Edit: After a lot of web searching, I've fixed the problem with too much yellow saturation.  It's a windows 11 problem, not the machine.  Poorly implemented color scheme files by Microsoft in the windows 11)  Build Quality.  So far, this machine is quite sturdy.  The materials are good, and it doesn't feel like I am going to break it.  Or worry about having problems with it in my backpack.  Everything fits together very nicely.  Also when removing the bottom shell to get into the guts of the machine, I didn't feel like I was going to break it, or anything else, while using the spreader to pop the clips apart.  I do recommend the proper tool for the job tho.  Don't just try to jerk it apart after taking all those screws out.  Keyboard:  As with any new laptop, getting used to the key layout is almost always a chore.  There is no unified layout for the specialty keys.  For just typing, the layout is REALLY good.  The keys are spaced together Just Right, and doesn't cause me to make as many typos as my larger machines, where the keys are spaced further apart.  They are very tactile, and make very little noise.  They don't have the feel of mechanical keyswitches.  They may be membrane keys, or a combination.  [Edit]  Membrane keys.  I would rather have switches personally, as it's less to replace, if one key, or a couple of keys fail.  But they work really well in this machine.Other than when I have the machine sitting awkwardly on my lap, I have absolute NO problems typing on this, and can hit the keys that I'm aiming for quite intuitively, with very little in the way or typos induced by the machine.  The backlighting is GREAT.  I can very clearly see and read the keys in low, and no light.  I do wish that they could use combined colors, so that I could set one part of the keyboard to one color, and a different part to a different color.  Which really assists in gaming, using keyboard shortcuts.  But for me, that's not a dealbreaker.  I can read them in the dark, and that is what I was wanting.  The layout for the specialty keys is ""Fairly"" standard.  Tho the sleep mode key being on F11 and especially the airplane mode being on F12 is something that is not a wise choice as those are pretty common shortkeys for quite a few programs.  Mouse:  The mouse functioned quite well, right out of the box.  I do wish that it was set a bit further to the left, in an offset style.  As the butts of my thumbs do pass across the pad.  But for a laptop this size, you get what you get.  The cursor sweeps across the screen quite well, with minimal effort, right out of the box.  Big plus.  It also uses hardwared mouse buttons.  Not corner clicks on the mousepad.  Honestly, thats a HUGE win, IMO.  The corner click system I've never really liked, its an area that collects dust and crud, and has to be cleaned.  Whether this suits you or not, well, that's individual taste ;)CON: This mousepad collects oil.  It collects oil REALLY bad.  Weight:  This machine is VERY PORTABLE.  The weight is quite light.  I was actually very surprised when I opened the box.  I almost wondered if there was something missing.  Between the machine itself, and the power brick, this is QUITE light.  My Sager laptop is a brick.  The powerbrick is huge and weighs a ton.  This machine is most definitely a very welcomed upgrade from that!  Noise:  This machine really surprised me as far as the (lack of) noise from the fans.  I have had cooling pads with fans in them that have made more noise than the cooling system in  this machine!  ASUS has really outdone themselves with the cooling system.  Tho as stated, I haven't tried gaming on this thing yet.  But so far, the noise level from this is  quite pleasant, and very unobtrusive.  [Edit] Ok, so the fans have kicked on.  They are no means loud, compared to some of the other laptops that I have owned.  It's actually pretty subdued, for laptop fans.Somebody else had mentioned that they sound kind of like airplane turbines.  Yeah!  They actually kind of do! :D  Which is cool!  But again, they're fairly quiet.  I seriously doubt that they would bother anybody except for maybe a fairly light sleeper.  Heat:  Again, a very pleasant surprise!  I've run this machine a straight, solid 24 hours, and have not had the fans kick on high.  There is no hot air blowing out of the side ports, and it's extrememly comfortable on the lap.  (One of my HP laptops has literally left bald spots on my legs from the heat!)  Upgrades:  There are two slots for RAM.  Which are the standard open the clips, slide the new one in/out variety.  This makes upgrading the RAM very simple.  There are two slots for m2 type Solid State boards, which are spaced widely apart.  This is not only making it very easy for install/removal, but also for heat control.  Next to the battery, (NOT removable!) [Edit]  (The battery IS removable.  Just not externally like older laptops.  You have to open it up, disconnect it, and then it can be removed/swapped. )  There is a connector for a 2.5"" SATA drive.  Which included connectors.  I myself don't like the idea of putting a drive that close to the battery.  But considering how little this machine is, and how little space there is inside... it has to go somewhere, right?  And at least, we can add a 3rd drive!  Boot up:  With the operating system installed on a SSD, this machine boots up really fast.  Granted windows will really slow it down when it decides to do a mandatory update.  But without those, I press the power up button and within seconds, I'm typing in my password.  Very nice!  Edit 3/25/23:  After installing 32gb of ram, the first boot up was a tad slow as the BIOS updated to the new system specs.  However.  After that.  Oh lord!  I hit the power button and I could log into the machine almost instantly.  Speed:  So far the processor/RAM/SSD combination is a winner.  Even Adobe Photoshop CS6 fires right up.  Haven't tried it with gaming so far, but so far, my intensive programs aren't suffering any kind of slow-down, stuttering, or lag.  The exception to this is my browser.  I run A LOT OF TABS when I am surfing.  And browsers are heavy RAM hogs.  Yeah, one of my browsers is getting a lot of hesitation.  But that will go away when I upgrade RAM.  Edit 3/25/23:  I've just installed 32gb of T-Force Zeus DDR4  3200 CL-22 Memory to the machine.  It was super easy as far as the computer was concerned.  The packaging for the memory gave me more trouble than putting it into the laptop, LOL.  But then, I'm also a computer technician, so your mileage may very depending on your experience level.  The machine now boots up at 9% memory usage.  The clockspeed is reporting at 2933.  This is not a defect in the laptop.  This is the BIOS not automatically being set to run memory at higher speeds.  You can look up the instructions of how to do this online.  It takes a few minutes.  But do so on another machine, as you will need to be able to read the instructions while this laptop boots up.  Look up ""How to enable XMP to run your RAM at full speed"".CONS  Size:  As I said before, this is a very small, portable machine.  In that aspect it is fantastic!  However.  The palm rest is small enough that if you use an external mouse  there is VERY little room on the palmrest to put a mouse on it, much less use it.  I am constantly running the mouse over the arrow keys and part of the numpad.  This has caused me problems as those keys interact with programs, when I don't want them to!  This for me, is a huge con, as I really do use a laptop ON my LAP.  The screen is also small.  While I don't have very good eyes anymore, it's clear and easy to read.  But for some of the applications that I use my machines for, a larger, external monitor is going to be a must.  Windows 11:  This is a personal choice.  I myself believe that Microsoft went in a very, very bad direction with the latest release of their OS.  I will be backtracking the Operating System on this machine backwards to Windows 10 at the very first opportunity.  [Edit]  I really do hate this operating system.  The look of it is similar, but much different in ways that I don't like.  I also do not like the way that MS did the new taskbar.  The right click context menus are also way, way different, and very much not to my liking. [Edit] I found how to revert the context menus, looking around on the web.Especially since the changes that they made to the right click context menus are NOT compatible with a lot of the software that I use.  Disassembly:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  Taking this machine apart to get to the guts is actually really simple.  There are 11 screws holding the plate underneath to  the machine.  They are easy to take out, and the plate is fairly easy to remove.  HOWEVER.  These screws are all different lengths!  So you HAVE to keep track of which one goes where!  NON-Removable  External battery:  This is an obvious con.  Not only can you not carry around a spare, but you cannot easily replace the existing one, if it goes bad. [Edit] As I noted before, yeah the battery can be replaced, but you have to open up the lower shell.  It's not a hot swappable battery that we got used to on older machines.  RAM slots.  Ok, this was a huge let down for me.  I was planning to simply take out the RAM from the machine that died, and put it in here to upgrade the low 8gb of ram that  it comes with.  It doesn't FIT!!  The pin arrangement is different, and the slot in the board is spaced further to the left.  I will have to look up what RAM this thing takes and purchase new boards to perform the upgrade.HOWEVER.  And this... this is awesome.  There's only ONE 8gb stick in this machine, when it arrived.  NOT paired 2x 4gb sticks.  What that means is that I can just throw another 8gb stick in here, and double the memory.  Without having to sacrifice a stick that was already in it.  Because it wasn't already in it!  Or, I could just throw in a single 16gb stick and instantly TRIPLE the ram, at significantly less coss.  I'm reading conflicting information about how much this machine supports.  Most say it's 32gb, while some say 64gb.I am more inclined to believe 32, but I don't know for sure.  Expansion slots:  Pretty much all of the connectors for USB, Video Out, and audio are all on the left side.  This, since an external monitor is going to be a must, will cause  some arrangement problems.  It could cause problems for people that also will be using this on a desk.  One thing that I love about my older Dell laptops is that they have some  of the afore mentioned ports at the BACK of the machine.  Or at the Rear Corners.  More USB ports would also be a very nice addition.  No Optical Drive.  Maybe I'm just a dinosaur, but I do miss having an optical drive bay.  Being able to watch DVDs or burn disk was a habit from way back in the day.  Or just taking the tray out, and swapping in a 2.5 sata drive through an adapter was also a very seriously nice option.  Ahhhh, progress LOL.  8 Gb of ram:  This combined with Win11, the LOAD of software marked with ASUS, and that crapware McCaffee pre-installed...  the machine is running at around 50% memory usage.  The Asus Monitoring software, along with the bloated goat OS is taking up quite bit of the system memory.  After uninstalling worthless McCaffee, I've cut it down to about 40% with 8gb RAM.  And as stated above, this machine takes different RAM boards than those used by machines from a few years ago.  512 GB Solid State Storage:  Ok.  This is a pro/con situation.  512 is quite good, in comparison to what similar machines are offering, which is half that.  At the same  pricepoint as these machines.  And as mentioned above, the machine will support up to 1tb storage boards, or SATA drive.  So there is definitely room for expansion with this machine.  However, to do so, IS an added expense.  And if you are planning on adding on a lot of games to this, you are definitely going to want to expand on the storage capacity!  Fortunately, it does have a sata slot.  Which means that you can add in a 1tb sata drive for considerably less money.Overall, the only thing that I'm going to complain about, is the size of the palm rests.  It's very comfortable for typing on.  But, as most of the applications that I use, I need those concise, accurate mouse movements.  And not having room to use a mouse on this machine is going to be a problem.That, and having to purchase windows 10 and what I will have to go through reinstalling drivers.  But again, that's a personal choice.",A great portable machine for daily use.  Mediocre gaming machine.,2022-12-18,5.0,R31WZZJHAD6UJ6,RSP,3.0,"So until the 13th generation of Intel CPU, the I series CPUs supported both EFI and bios legacy OS installation and booting yet this laptop has had that option removed. There is also no way to disable TPM which means Windows 11 just gets to install itself whenever it wants and you don't get a choice unless you want to solo boot Linux. Oh and you wanted to do a uefi/legacy bios Windows Linux dual boot so that they don't cross contaminate? F*** you says Asus, because as I previously mentioned that's not an option because they removed it. Also if you bought this laptop because of its promises to be easy to upgrade, it wasn't offensively bad but it has no right marketing itself that way, it was still fairly annoying to get the back plate off. As another note they used multiple different sizes of screw to hold in the back plate and only one of them is captive... Dell latitude e6410 from 2011 had only three screws of the same size and one of them was captive. I won't ask to return it unless something seriously bad goes wrong but my first day impressions are pretty bad. Oh also Aunt asus's website they will tell you that this laptop only supports 32 GB of RAM but I currently have 64 GB of RAM on it and it registers all of it... You can tell from Windows task Manager that they artificially make it so you can't access two of the ram slots it was supposed to have as well so they further undermine the theme of upgradability. It does come with the gddr6 1650, and to this device is credit when I put it through hell playing about 10 hours of video games yesterday, it kept the GPU very cool, however the laptop's underside got almost certainly OSHA violation level of hot, so under no circumstances should you buy this for business usage.Ultimately it did however over perform benchmarks I had seen previously on YouTube in Halo infinite and the performance was not bad. I will say with all of this bad it is still the best asus product I have used thus far, I will update this review again if that changes.",Very Underwhelming and it has the worst UEFI/BIOS I have ever interacted with,2023-02-11,3.0

Through the years I’ve bought several Asus computers because I like the product. So quite naturally when it was time for me to upgrade, I bought this one.

No amount of adjusting the brightness, contrast, etc. will fix this issue. If you already have challenges with your vision like i do (ie wearing corrective items like glasses, contacts, etc. ), you need to think twice before buying this thing because it will create more of a hardship for your eyes.

Good laptop,11.0,R3S557UMJCWECL,L. Brown,80.0,"See update at end...Buying a refurbished PC (desktop or laptop) can be dicey. You never know if you're going to get a hidden gem or an incompetently rebuilt piece of garbage. I have bought about a dozen of them, and promptly returned just more than half.This laptop is by far the most completely refurbed PC I have purchased. It looks new--the screen, the body, even the touchpad (which almost always shows wear) look untouched. It is definitely the nicest laptop I've had. The specs are exactly as listed, down to DDR4 memory and a battery that shows only 24 previous discharge/recharge cycles, far better than most refurbs.A word of advice for purchasers trying to figure out if a purchased refurb will work for them: -Don't expect anything to work well right out of the box. You will have to spend some time getting it in running order. Think of your time spent as balancing the $ you saved buying refurbished! (No, this isn't because the refurbisher didn't do their job. Once they get everything working, they will only do a clean install of Windows. The rest is up to you, just like it would be with a new computer.) -The first thing any Windows machine when you finish the guided set up (IF you connected to a wifi or wired network) is start installing Windows updates. (You can check progress by selecting ""Check for updates"" from the start menu.) Until all updates are finished, it will be slow. It might even restart seemingly at random. Once you think all updates are installed, reboot and check for updates until it shows ""You're up to date"". This can take quite some time with a slow network connection, so be sure you're using fast wifi or even plug in an ethernet cable until ALL updates are done. -While updates are installing, check the specs to make sure they are what you bought. Don't assume. The built-in Windows System Information app is a good place to start. There are lots of free apps for reporting on the HDD, memory, and battery. Check Google. If ANYTHING seems off, ask the seller about it. If you don't like the answer, return it! -Next go to the manufacturer's support website and install all available driver updates (including BIOS!). I can't oversell the importance here. Many manufacturers have an app you can download to streamline this process (for HP it is HP Support Assistant). NOTE: If something stops working during this step (function keys or bluetooth are the most likely things to stop working), Google away until you find a solution. Someone has run into the same problem before, and the solution is probably there to be found. -After these steps, you should have a fully functional computer. Test it out and see if it actually meets your needs. If not, contact the seller. If you aren't happy with the response, return it!One word of warning: the touchpad is textured. I can see this bothering some people, but I kind of like it. It makes it really easy to move the mouse precisely vertically, in line with the lines of the texture.I hope this helps someone who is on the edge about whether to buy this or not. Thank you, seller!-----------UPDATE: After using this laptop for a couple of weeks, I thought I should add an update. I do wish the display was a bit better. The colors wash out easily, especially at lower levels.It's also worth noting that the processor on this model is not listed as compatible for the Windows 11 upgrade. Not a big deal to me, but worth noting.",Wow. Just wow.,2021-07-13,5.0,R320K5CB86S5WV,Tyler ,11.0,"I received this machine on 12/4/22. The shipping was delayed but nothing too extreme. The first problem I noticed is the Touch Pad. I am unable to use two fingers and scroll up and down on a page. This machine was purchased for my company and we found this issue a major problem in our operations. However, I said ""It's fine, we will work around it and use a mouse"". That went alright for the first 10 minutes until I found that some of the keys aren't functioning the way they should be. This includes the brightness of the screen (bright and dim) seems to refresh and tab through sections vs lowering and raising the brightness. The other function that doesn't work is the volume buttons ( again, up and down ). This became frustrating quite quickly. Again, I said we will work around this issue. The final straw was when we were setting up the laptop. We found that we couldn't install drivers for the touch pad because they are not available. Also, we are not able to use the finger print feature to unlock the computer. Again, we are not able to install drivers because they are not available. At the end of the day, we have decided to move forward with a return and refund.PLEASE BE AWARE******THIS IS NOT A BAD LAPTOP. For the price, this laptop is exceptional. It will get the job done if you plan to use a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse. With the occasional ""laptop"" setting. I am still able to function with added steps but it becomes frustrating as I operate on other laptops that function the way that I want them too. Please do not be afraid to purchase this laptop as renewed because it is exactly that. I am still able to do all the functions of my job as needed but takes different steps. IT WILL GET THE JOB DONE.So please keep that in mind.",PLEASE READ ENTIRE REVIEW. Good laptop,2022-12-05,3.0

I called Acer support they told me you have to click the charger in till you hear 2 clicks and not 1 which I felt like should have been stated in the instructions somewhere or something. Fast forward 3 days later I turned my computer on and it was just at a black screen nothing was happening. Turned it off then back on black screen still present. Called Acer support told them that after the computer tried to up date and next day I turned it on that was present they walked me through so steps to reset the software and 5 minutes later it was running again. To say the least it’s fast it plays Fortnite really well with no issues and few other games I play. The downside to this PC is all the bloatware I tried deleting the bloatware some won’t let me delete and the others I click delete and it freezes up on the task. The keyboard only is red but you can adjust the brightness and or turn it off.

Do not expect it to run the latest games or any graphically intensive applications.  With that stated, I am utilizing these at a non profit charity that which mostly utilizes cloud based applications.  These computers work very well at this task while providing the future proofing of being Windows 11 compliant.We are replacing ACER Aspire E15 series laptops with this model.  The E15s were mostly generation 7 & 8 I3 and i5 models with SATA III SSDs and 8GB of RAM.  The NVMe drives are much faster than the older SATA III drives.  I miss the extra RAM, but not enough to crack open these cases for upgrades.  My volunteers appreciate the lighter weight and slimmer size.  I don't remember the last time we actually utilized an optical drive or card reader which were lost with the slimmer case.These have smaller batteries than our older models.  That coupled with the CPU and RAM workload increase, means that I anticipate 5 - 6 hours of battery life utilizing basic cloud based applications.  Streaming movies or playing basic games will decrease the life more.  Non CPU intensive desktop productivity software should increase the battery life.  The power port is proprietary so you will need to carry the brick and cords if you need more battery life during your day.  From an IT prospective, this is a blessing due to the number of infected USB C chargers that have begun popping up in public spaces.Most of the volunteers in the organization are older and greatly appreciate the larger display size.  There is no touch display option.  The maximum resolution is 1920x1080, but the overall quality does not keep up with mid level or elite laptops.  The viewing angle is about 120 degrees from the side and less from the top.  Graphics performance is low.  The colors are not as rich and the contrast is not as dynamic as better displays.  This does include HDMI 2.0.  I do not think it could drive a display with higher resolution very well though.  It is fine for plugging presentations in to a projector or large display.  I do not see much improvement on this display vs the 2017 - 2019 ACER E15 series laptops these are replacing.The webcam is basic.  The speakers are small and face down.  There is a single microphone.  If you speak on calls, a headset is a must.  If you listen on calls, this is adequate provided your space is quiet enough for the small speakers.  The overall sound quality is a compromise between value and quality leaning heavily on value.The keyboard is textured.  It is not backlit.  There is not indication that Caps lock or Number Lock are engaged.  So far, I prefer it to the usual flat chiclet keyboards that haunt modern laptops.  The key response is good.  The number pad keys are smaller than the regular keys and some of the buttons are not in standard 10 key locations.  The keyboard also does not use the standard inverted T for the arrow keys.  This is either a learning curve or an annoyance depending on the user.  Time will tell regarding dust and foreign debris issues and how difficult it is to change a key, switch or the entire keyboard.The touchpad is large enough to cover the display area adequately.  It is sensitive enough to cover tap clicking or actual clicking depending on user preference.  I do miss the button that disables the touchpad to eliminate palm pressing, but that disappeared with optical drives on every computer.The ports are great.  This laptop has  2 USB 3.2 and one USB C on the left side, and one USB 2.0 on the right side.  It also has gigabit ethernet and HDMI 2.0 on the left side and a headphone port on the right side.  The SD card reader has disappeared to no big loss.  Many of my volunteers prefer corded mice and happen to be right handed.  A USB port on the right side is really nice.  The power port is proprietary since this is USB C instead of Thunderbolt 3/4.  That is a nice range of current and future connectivity.  The average user will not need to utilize a dock or USB hub with this laptop.The WI-FI supports both 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz protocols.  It maxes out at WI-FI 5 speeds.  The built in ethernet port is gigabit which maxes out at 125mbps.  Both are adequate for streaming, web browsing, email, and basic Internet use.  Most home networks are gigabit so this slots in very well.  I was able to maintain transfers at 2.3GBe with a USB 3.2 to 2.5GBe adapter.  There is no wireless upgrade option.You can access the main board and components with nothing more than a 00 Phillips screwdriver.  There is a single RAM slot and it utilizes NVMe 3.0.  The base model is a little light on both RAM and storage, but for a workstation, it is adequate.  For a more power user, you can upgrade both, which is nice and becoming rare in most laptops.  The NVMe drive is not heat shielded nor is it installed in a place with good airflow.  I would not be surprised to encounter heat throttling during periods of heavy use.  The overall drive life may be compromised as well.  Time will tell.  There are no additional unused SATA, PCI, or NVMe ports for expansion.  You cannot upgrade the CPU and there is no expansion port to add discrete graphics.  No surprise there.I immediately exited Windows S mode during initial setup.  Any program that won't allow a user to even utilize a different browser, isn't right for me.  This may be nice if you are attempting to keep users away from applications and websites of questionable origin but our desktop software will never be listed in the MS store and our cloud based software is not stable in Edge.The bottom line is that this laptop is designed for non power users and companies looking for a laptop that is more powerful and less controlled than the average Chromebook.  If your user experience is surfing the Internet, streaming videos, checking email, and running software that will never be listed in an App Store, this is a great option.  If you want to play games, or edit video or graphics, this is not the right choice for you.  Based on previous ACER experience, we anticipate 5 years of service out of these which is a great return of investment.",Not a powerhouse but acceptable for low end workstation use,2023-04-09,4.0,R2PYXX8IEARFZ4,Klaymate,223.0,"If I thought anyone would read the one to two star reviews, that's more likely what I would have rated this product. The laptop itself is fine but the operating system experience is really the part that makes me regret my purchase.For context my wife owns a slightly earlier model of this laptop and it seemed decent so I purchased the Acer Aspire 5 A515-56-53S3 model. I opted to spring for the model with a decent graphics card (Iris XE) and larger solid state drive(storage) because my intent was to use this to play low end/low effort games on the couch while the kiddo and wife watched shows or movies. Even though it suffers from a shortage of RAM, it does seem like it will serve the purpose however I am disappointed with the user experience overall.Straight to the point: Windows 11 is awful. My wife's laptop came with windows 10, I helped her set it up and customize it the way she likes it. The laptop I just purchased came with windows 11 and it is an entirely different story. The initial setup alone was exhausting with multiple attempts by Microsoft to get me to agree to letting them track everything I do, including specific text regarding logging everything I type as well as my browser history and web interactions. They also attempt to sell you Microsoft services right off the bat in the form of free trial periods for 365, their cloud services and more. A few of them even note ""credit card required"" next to the automatically checked box if you wanted to continue. To me this felt pretty crummy. I just bought a 500 dollar laptop and they are already trying to get more money out of me before I even finish the initial setup. Acer adds to the issue by also offering deals, software and registering the product in exchange for services I have absolutely no interest in.It would be alright if it stopped there but unfortunately that is only the beginning of my disdain. I have only had the laptop for about 19 days and yet it seems like every other time I boot up the system something new pops up. The first few times it was programs installing themselves and congratulating me on my newly unrequested/not permitted acquisitions. Acer took it upon themselves to load Norton Antivirus on my system well after I finished the initial setup process. Icons for Amazon web games are created and appear in my start bar/menu randomly. I've deleted the Microsoft edge browser icon off my desktop and start bar and yet it continues to reappear. Its asked to update 3 times in the 19 days that I've owned it. It seems like one of out every 3 times I start the system it seems slow and sluggish to fully load windows only to find out something has been added without my consent. Which is especially anoying seeing that the system already comes with tons of applications pre loaded similar to buying a new smart phone. Tiktok, messanger apps, amazon prime, Disney+ and more, perhaps Im getting old but I would much rather install what I want myself then have to uninstall tons of apps I will never use from the system.As stated before there is not much RAM, even on the higher end model I purchased. Checking the performance page in task manager you can see that even without any other self installed apps running, windows and Acer's apps consume 4 of the 8 GB of system RAM. Uninstalling and shutting down a bunch of truly unessential apps and services I was able to get it down to 3/8 GB. The 256GB SSD is also already partially consumed by windows itself which no amount of uninstalling pre loaded apps seems to resolve.It does have enough resources to play games including some older titles that have 3D graphic requirements. I have not tried to play modern titles or expect it to play more graphic intensive titles but 3D style graphic MMORPGs, Adventure games and the like run pretty well. It does seem to have some issues playing intros and cut scenes sometimes and most annoying is the fact that letting the laptop go to sleep by inactivity or closing the lid causes most games to either crash outright or become slow and consistently stutter to the point where you have to close and reopen the application to resolve the issue.Battery life is about where I would expect it. Playing graphic games seems to drain it pretty quick. 90% to 40% in about 2 hours of running a low end games. It will last a short flight or a long movie but I expect to have to have it plugged in when ever I wanna really sink into playing something. Speakers are good enough as I wouldn't expect anything great out of a compact laptop. Screen looks crisp and bright.I cannot say I will likely return the laptop just based on the fact that almost all other laptops available at this point will will also have Windows 11 installed. Its not really an issue with the hardware as much as it's just the operating system that really rubs me the wrong way. I don't feel like its my personal computer. It feels more like a smart phone. I am having less and less faith the system will stay how I left it. The updates are forced and can only be put off for a max of 3 weeks. Gone are the days of getting a system how you like it and it staying that way. Here to stay is the age of only partial owning your system, being subjected to constant updates and with that the assumption its going to run worse and worse over time, plus always having some new unwanted surprise in store every time it is powered up.",Pretty disappointing,2023-01-04,3.0

You can throw a lot at it and it won't budge, however, do be mindful that this is still a laptop.  Cooling will be the primary issue as is the case with most other laptops.The good- The version I received came with a 10 core 12th gen i7, a dedicated 4050 GPU with 6GB of VRAM.  This is more than sufficient for my gaming, photoshop, programming, and productions needs.  I debated splurging on a laptop with a larger 17"" screen, for my purposes though 15"" is enough.  The brightness and clarity are great.  144Hz is an excellent feature, but considering the nature of this machine I would prefer 120Hz.  Allow me to clarify, I understand Hz has everything to do with the screen refresh rate.  I also understand most games can be capped around 120FPS, by capping the two it can allow cooling headroom.The mediocre- at $1K is 512GB of SSD space the best you can really do?  I immediately took my machine apart and installed an aftermarket 4TB crucial NVMe and a 4TB Samsung 980 Evo, in addition to replacing the RAM from 16GB to 64GB.  I understand this sounds like overkill, and it is... to an extent.  Beyond gaming I run virtualization software and edit photography shots for my side gig.  Running virtualized labs exhausts a lot of resources, and due to the nature of travel associated with my work, I can't always utilize my desktop.  Audio isn't the greatest on this machine either, the sounds are washed out due to the speakers being place on the bottom.The bad - expandability.  This is 2023, disk space should be expandable by now without voiding the warranty.  I am well aware I can purchase an external drive, but it blows my mind that modern day devices have the ability to be customized - e.g Disk space/RAM, etc, but the warranty must be void in order to do so.  These are relatively low risk modifications.The ugly- cooling, 100%.  MSI BIOS by default runs turbo, add Windows 11 to the mix and you have a deadly concoction on your hands.  This toasty boi almost peaked around 92C.  Yes, modern day equipment can run this hot, will it stand the test of time though?  I am not one to take that risk.  I managed to take 20C off of my average temps, which should hopefully increase the longevity of my laptop.What would my suggestion to the manufacturer be?- First and foremost disable turbo, it's unnecessary.  The laptop is certainly capable of performing under extreme workloads but it's not exactly practical when the temperature is teetering around it's throttle limit.- A thicker base for a more robust heatsink.  I know this is counterintuitive to the specific design of this product since it is supposed to be thing.  This could expand the life of the product though.Suggestions for the consumer- Turn off turbo in BIOS, it requires enabling advanced mode but the rewards are worth it.- Get rid of Windows 11, it's absolute garbage in its current state.  Maybe by the next iteration they will have fixed it.  For now, install Windows 10 via USB or install a user friendly Linux Distro like Mint, Debian, or Ubuntu.- Purchase an aftermarket laptop stand/cooler.  I don't have any particular one to suggest since I'm still in the search for something I think will perform the job correctly.Final thoughtsThis is a solid 7.5/10 laptop.  It's not bleeding edge by today's standards, but it will do more than just get you by especially if you are a student on a budget who enjoys games on the side.  This laptop also serves as a great multipurpose device with a few component modifications.  That all depends on if you are willing to risk voiding the warranty or not.  As an IT professional I suggest not doing so if you are not comfortable with the thought of that.","The good, the bad, and the ugly",2023-06-03,4.0,R2LET4Y973RTQB,Miao,0.0,"I received this 9/11, and start use it on 9/13 after re-installing the Microsoft system. I found the keyboard, screen, electricity and attachments are all nice. This is a relative cheap price according to the set-ups.However, the TouchPad is completely not usable. I opened it 9/12 and found the TouchPad is off, so I tried fn-f3 and re-installing the system. When I start again on 9/13, the TouchPad is still off. I also tried to install msi TouchPad drive and turn off the I2C HID in device management, but nothing changes. I may consider this as a hardware break.I can use my mouse to control the computer, and I have a lot of work to do on it, so there is a large chance that I will not return it or change it (except the seller is kind enough to mail me a new one before I give it back :>). I will use the MSI warranty instead, but it will be several months after that.I typed this rate on 9/14 00:30, after tried several hours trying to repair TouchPad. I will recommend this, since 700-800 dollars is really not expensive under this set of laptop; I also believe that the TouchPad broken on a new laptop is really rare thing. I am sharing my real experience and remain this as an evidence.Thank you for reading! Can anyone provide solution to this problem?","Most are good, TouchPad is down",2023-09-14,3.0

The 13th gen i7 chip feel like it can handle anything I throw at it, with good battery life, a beautiful screen, all the little features that make it easy to use.  The software tools to work seamlessly with my other Samsung devices are handy, too; I can wirelessly use my phone or tablet as a second display for the laptop, or just use the laptop's mouse and keyboard to interact with my phone and laptop. The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop. If that's the tradeoff for having a thin device with a lid that is going to stay securely closed, though, I'm good with it.Overall, it's a great laptop and I expect to be using it as a main device for many years.",Portable and Powerful,2023-08-22,5.0,R31BLNPXMW2N0P,Josef Farkas,33.0,"This is an interesting product: it has superb video and sound performance but the rest is just average. Here are some observations.The Pros: as mentioned earlier.The Cons: 1. The hardware details on the USB ports say that it is from the 2006 Specs! Wow!2. The Taskbar can only be partially expanded to the left, the hidden icons can't be dragged out.3. The laptop can't properly connect to a Samsung A53-5G phone nor to a Samsung  S6-Lite  Tablet. It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither. Sorry Samsung, I expect another take on the design of such laptops and hope to see a star performer having a competitive price.","Superb and Excellent Video and Sound, Average rest of the components and Performance.",2023-04-20,3.0

HP stated the reason Windows would not activate was that the seller did not use Genuine HP parts when they upgraded the laptop which flagged the system. It also voided the manufacturer's warranty on those specific parts. HP helped me solve the problem since they have 24/7 service,  and this was a Friday evening.

I had been using an AMD 3200u for several years, but it was clearly showing its age. I was pleasantly surprised to come across this laptop with a 5625u at such an affordable price. The Geekbench scores are quite close to those of the 5600u.The first thing I did, and I highly recommend this to anyone else, is to add a 16GB (8GB works fine too) stick of 3200MHz RAM, bringing the laptop's total to 24GB. The improvement in performance with dual-channel memory is significant.What's most surprising is the battery life, considering the power and the large 17"" screen. While I can't provide exact numbers due to varying usage patterns, I can easily get several hours of work done before needing to recharge.The screen is decent for my needs—not outstanding, but far from terrible.Although I primarily purchased this laptop for work, I couldn't resist installing a few games out of curiosity. To my amazement, this little APU held its own. It can handle some older titles at high settings and even newer ones at lower settings. What surprised me the most was when I tried playing Doom Eternal. Running it at 720p on all low settings, the game was surprisingly playable. While I wouldn't recommend this laptop as a gaming PC, it's worth mentioning that it can handle older titles, emulations, or kids' games with ease.","Nothing is more powerful for the price, battery life is insane.",2023-09-11,5.0,R3ELWUII2ICCOI,Les,0.0,"These laptops are not able to be registered for warranty outside of the USA. Lanovo will only register these laptops in the USA. Unlike ThinkPads there is no IWS service warranty, so, no warranty for a brand new machine. A used like new ThinkPad is better than purchasing one of these laptops, you can purchase an extended warranty and IWS service is afforded for them. Much more machine for a lot less money if you shop around. Be careful though with the refurbished laptops, some may have low quality replacement parts and I do not know if you purchase the extended warranty if they will cover those parts. Still, much better to buy excellent quality refurbished. Just check with Lanovo online as soon as you receive that the serial number which is tied to the original motherboard is accepted on their system.When I first checked the warranty it showed as expired and I contacted Amazon because I thought it might have been used. Amazon assured me it was new and able to get a warranty. When I attempted to register for warranty is when I found out the ugly truth. No warranty out side of the US.When I contacted Amazon they did say I could return it, but they would not arrange for pickup return, they claimed they had no return shipping service for my area.I had to ship it back, paying from my own pocket the shipping fee. When I questioned about reimbursement for the shipping fees I did not get a clear commitment, just phrases like no worries we will “help” with the return shipping fees.I contacted Amazon several times after trying to be comfortable with returning the laptop without losing any money. Sorry, but the words they used were ambiguous to me. It was not worth returning the laptop if I am going to lose money on it.Shippers refused it because it has a lithium battery. FedEx accepted it, the cost is about $168 in USD. I informed Amazon and still heard “no worries”, just return it.They just did not seem to understand I did not want to return it if I was going to lose any money on it.The best I could understand from Amazon is my refund will be handled this way;Item cost and ship to cost after returned to the seller. Although the ad says fulfilled by and sold by Amazon, I was told by the last CSR that it was not sold by Amazon and had to be returned to the seller.I don’t know what is true.The import fees could take up to six months to be returned.How, when and if I get the return of the $168 cost to ship the laptop was basically left in the “No worries, just ship it back” column.  One suggestion by a CSR was a “promotion”, I told them a “promotion” was not helpful. Why should I be punished and forced to accept a “promotion” for that much money when it is Amazon that lacks the ability to arrange return shipping?I am taking the risk shipping it back to give Amazon a chance, but at this point I am afraid I am getting misled.Past experience with Amazon has been very good, but this and an order that is messed up placed after this have me really on edge.Right now I am out of pocket over $700 and unsure of if/when I will be made whole on the transaction.What good is “helping” me with a promotion when I may face another issue on a future order. I understand Amazon loses money on the situation. But I just want what was indicated I was paying for.I still see these laptops being sold internationally without informing that unlike Lanovo ThinkPads they are not eligible warranty registration out side of the US and do not have IWS warranty coverage.If Amazon is going to continue to sell these as New Lanovo Laptops internationally they should make it very clear that they are not eligible for warranty out side of the US.

Old one just wasn't cutting it. This one has a awesome prime day sale plus I got a 990pro and 32gb crucial memory(max it takes).(edit) I also just noticed it does not support HDR huge thumbs down.1.Biggest draw backs I noticed it's kind of a pain to upgrade you need to take the whole bottom off 11 screws all of which do not want to come out of holes because of locktight used on them.2. Even when playing older games it will max out the GPU doesn't matter if it's 1080 or 2k constantly have the 4060 under full load and fans running high and the CPU under full load.3. Performance is good not blown away by it. Didn't realize the 4060 wasn't running under a full power load would of been better off with a 3080ti laptop with full power that were on sale.4. Needs more 3.2 USB ports  has 2 USB3 but the USB ports are on the right handed side causing me to loose more room for my mouse space poor design. Put one on the back or the other side. The back does have 2 USB-C so ill try a adapter and see if that works. ( it does)5.Bios leaves much to be desired. Really has everything blocked off and does not give you much control over it.6. Found out it does not have HDR I guess I just assumed it did for playing games. It says it does but doesn't show up on any games it shows up greyed out so still investigating. But when I researched it says it does.The good1.Thermals didn't seem to get much hotter then 71-78c on the GPU-CPU under full load for long time. Up to (82c update 9-27-23) use a good fan.2. Processor seemed to do its job was kinda worried to how it ranked with a 13th gen Intel.3. Has a extra m.2 drive for a 990pro (on sale right now) and can put new memory It does run at 5600hz max is 32gb! Has run everything I've thrown at it. Don't use gaming setup under the nitro app keeps fans at full blast use performance. Fans at full blast can rival and 747 Plane in Db range  if you leave it on gaming profile. Do not do this you cant even hear games. It leaves fans on full all the time in the Nitro Center.I do have it all upgraded running 2 990 pros 2tb each one with a heat sink one without about 10c difference.  32gb of memory. Maxed everything out I could. Runs great with a $cooler it has one big fan in the middle can always keep it around 70c. Don't expect to be running many games on ultra unless they support dss 3.2. But overall alot of games on medium or high. Some on ultra. I'm happy for the $1000. Sale I got on it. Put another $400-$600 in it and should last me 5-7 yrs of mid tier gaming.

It basically functions....Pro/ConPro: It functions.It can handle the business side of things such as running a Point of Sales system and VPN and handle me using it to work on website and other business required processes at a decent speed. Nothing super fast but nothing too slow either.It looks nice and it will NOW login correctly and in a semi timely manner so I can start work day relatively easily on the go.Microsoft support did help me get past login error the device had. Even if in a roundabout way.That is basically it for good.Cons: To start I was able to get laptop and get a sign in going with the proper account on microsoft account. Day 2 went to login and after putting in password it suggested I make a PIN I said skip for now. It takes me back to login screen to put in account email and password again. Back to PIN screen to make or skip. Tried skipping. Back to Login screen again. Third time I selected create PIN. ""Error cannot create PIN at this time.""....... It did this for all manners of different cycles. Could never create PIN and could never skip PIN entry.... took 3 hours of dealing with Microsoft support and editting stuff in BIOS to get the laptop to skip the PIN entry and even let me use the laptop. So now I can login without PIN entry though I still cannot create a PIN for account which shouldn't even be required since I also already have a microsoft authenticator and a few other security layers for account.Con 2 its slow.... for a brand new laptop it should not be running same speed for downloads as my 9 year old laptop that I am have as backup. (battery dead and only works when plugged in. screen flickering so I know its going to stop working soon.) I can compare speeds easily. Same network same conditions only difference is my old laptop also has a ton of other things running just from past years. (Extra start ups and background programs.) So this Brand New computer should not be running slower.It also cannot even run some basic game emulators (Free games no I am not stealing them. Indie developers) But for those who don't know these are usually pixel games that don't use much computer power to run. My old and dying laptop runs them just slightly  better..but I got this new laptop so I could run them better.Con 3 the keys are a bit off. They don't always register a full downpress for if you type faster. I have been using computers for a long time and tend to type rather fast. I know I make errors and such but am pretty accurate most of the time. This laptop it seems to not register them unless key is pressed rather heavily down and deliberately.Summary: Honestly if it didnt take me 12 plus hours to install all the work related programs and set up all the things in it so I could run business side of things. I would want to replace this in an instant. Maybe try same one but get one less faulty? Or if it is just 'How this laptop is'. I might get a different one.Sadly I have already put a lot of time into getting this one going and with the business stuff on it I don't want to just send it back without doing a very hard scrub of it to make sure no business information is still saved on it which would probably void some kind of warranty.If you want a laptop to function as something to just watch Youtube. Edit pictures or just do other similarly menial things. This laptop should be fine and is a rather decent pricing.If you plan on even attempting to do anything further, edit videos download bigger programs or run anything bigger then playing some videos at same time or streams...Don't...unless I by chance just happen to have a faulty one.",Quality Meh.

The keys are not clicky but sort of hollow sounding, which isn't too bad. The fans turn on and off constantly and WEEEESHHHHHHHH for minutes at a time (all I've done so far is load Chrome). The worst thing for me is the touchpad makes a sound like you're dragging your finger over bad paper from grade-school chapter books. I'm autistic (and admittedly have a headache right now ((there go the fans for no reason))) and I'm extremely sensitive to noises and this fffsffssffsfsfsfsfssssssss sound is super irritating. My old HP had a nice smooth touchpad that literally made NO NOISE, why oh why would they change it? I'm already trying to duck the noise my own fingers are making, or using my other hand to cover it up to deaden the noise. I'll end up using this with headphones in a lot, which will make my husband sad...Still sitting here with the fans going, and they actually cover up the noise of the touchpad...

Thus, if your laptop experiences any problems after 30 days, there is no recourse for your problems without absorbing exorbitant costs relative to the laptop's price. The seller is aware of these issues but intentionally does not advertise the voided warranty or the cheap hard drive replacements to customers.Español: Actualizaciones baratas incluídas en la computadora anulan la garantía del fabricante automaticamente. De este modo, si la computadora tuivera problemas despues de 30 dias, no habría más remedio que absorber el costo del reemplazo de la laptop. El vendedor es consciente de estos detalles, pero intencionalmente no les anucia a los clientes la garantía anulada ni el reemplazo con un disco duro barato.I hope some future buyers will find this review useful as an alert to the misleading, shady, and uncooperative business practices of this seller. I bought this Victus Gaming Laptop from this seller sometime around November/December 2022. I enjoyed the laptop for about a month before the hard drive failed. In January 2023, the laptop would no longer start-up, and I was met with a ""3F0"" error. I called HP—the manufacturer of the laptop that the seller says is responsible for the warranty—assuming that the laptop was still under warranty given that it was within one year of purchase. It took a few weeks to work with them over the phone to run tests remotely to assess the problem, during which I couldn't use the laptop for gaming. Ultimately, they determined the problem was due to the SSD hard drive failure. This didn't make sense at the time since I had only used the laptop for light gaming, never having even moved it from my desk. HP requested that I mail in the laptop for repairs. I later received a message from the HP repair team notifying me that it was a hard drive failure due to a ""cheap hard drive replacement"" from a 3rd party. They also informed me that any 3rd party modifications automatically void the warranty, so HP would NOT repair the laptop for free under warranty and instead requested ~$450 to repair it. When I told HP that the laptop arrived to me with these modifications, they responded that they receive many laptops for repairs with these cheap hard drive replacements after purchasing the laptop on Amazon. They acknowledged that this was not my fault but that the warranty was still voided. They suggested I contact the seller instead.I contacted the seller and described the problem. I reasonably requested a refund or other reasonable solution. They responded unapologetically that they ""are not responsible for the warranty which is all up to the manufacture"" and that they only provide the ""standard 30 days return period"". First off, their unapologetic tone and inflexibility in trying to find a reasonable solution are insulting to the customer. Secondly, the upgrades are listed on the page; however, they do not advertise that there is no warranty or recourse if the laptop breaks down. They knowingly say that the ""warranty is up to the manufacturer"" but know that these upgrades will void the warranty. They do not alert their customers to this. It's suspicious that my laptop should break down after 1 month / 30 days, which is right outside their return window. Not notifying the customer that the laptop will not come with a warranty while also replacing the hard drive with a cheap replacement is clearly misleading and disrespectful to customers. I will file a complaint with Amazon and work as many avenues as possible to ensure that other customers do not fall victim to this unfair policy and misleading business practices.","Be wary that warranty is void on purchase, seller is unapologetic and misleading",2023-03-30,1.0

I hope I'm wrong because I never want to leave a bad review, but there are indicators in the system showing it was a used laptop. I am disappointed that it wasn't at the very least wiped clean and that It wasn't clear I was buying a used laptop.  Especially a 2020.

The 13th gen i7 chip feel like it can handle anything I throw at it, with good battery life, a beautiful screen, all the little features that make it easy to use.  The software tools to work seamlessly with my other Samsung devices are handy, too; I can wirelessly use my phone or tablet as a second display for the laptop, or just use the laptop's mouse and keyboard to interact with my phone and laptop. The fingerprint sensor inside the power button is a great innovation I didn't even know I needed.If there is any niggle to note, the lid is a little tricky to open with one hand. The hinge is strong enough to keep the device closed, and the laptop itself is so light to begin with, that lifting on the front of the lid will usually just slide the whole thing around on the desk instead of opening it up. I have to lightly brace the back of the laptop with one hand and opening it with the other. It takes barely a touch, but it's quickly become a habit to use both hands to open the laptop. If that's the tradeoff for having a thin device with a lid that is going to stay securely closed, though, I'm good with it.Overall, it's a great laptop and I expect to be using it as a main device for many years.",Portable and Powerful,2023-08-22,5.0,R31BLNPXMW2N0P,Josef Farkas,33.0,"This is an interesting product: it has superb video and sound performance but the rest is just average. Here are some observations.The Pros: as mentioned earlier.The Cons: 1. The hardware details on the USB ports say that it is from the 2006 Specs! Wow!2. The Taskbar can only be partially expanded to the left, the hidden icons can't be dragged out.3. The laptop can't properly connect to a Samsung A53-5G phone nor to a Samsung  S6-Lite  Tablet. It looks like that the laptop wants to connect but it immediately disconnects.4. The embedded  fingerprint reader in the power button is very flaky, it worked the first time, did not survive a reboot. Enrolled two fingers again, worked while ON and again, disappeared after the reboot.5. It does not have Thunderbolt ports, only USB3.x, therefore the backup to either and external USB drive or a NAS, is about 330-350Mb/s as opposed to the same external devices from an LG17 which has the Thunderbolt ports, the backup rate is about 1100Mb/s.6. The Samsung 16 Laptop is about 2X the weight of the slightly larger LG17.7. In all fairness, the $1750 cost of the Samsung Laptop is substantially higher with lower performance than other comparable laptops. The earlier mentioned Samsung phone and tablet perform superbly while having a competitive cost, this laptop has neither. Sorry Samsung, I expect another take on the design of such laptops and hope to see a star performer having a competitive price.","Superb and Excellent Video and Sound, Average rest of the components and Performance.",2023-04-20,3.0

During the initial setup, and for the first 2 days, it was moving a little sluggish, but the Task Manager showed that it was Windows processes that was using most of the CPU and RAM at the time (happens to all computers from time to time). Outside of that, the performance is flawless. I have used it to play Halo: Master Chief Collection, and it runs like a beauty!Wi-Fi speeds are immaculate! The Wi-Fi chip performs flawlessly! Not to mention that it is also equipped with an ethernet port as well. No complaints here.Screen:Upon first bootup of the desktop (after the setup screen), I IMMEDIATELY saw the quality of the screen. Viewing angles are just about perfect as well! This is my first foray into 144Hz territory, and I love it! Transitions are smooth, and I often move the mouse pointer from one corner to another just to enjoy the frame rate. The screen gets plenty bright for indoor use, and suitable for outdoor use as well. Direct sunlight, however, is a bit of a letdown. At the same time, I don't like or suggest using PCs in direct sunlight if possible, as the heat is not good for the device.The color accuracy leaves a little to be desired, as it does not provide 100% of the sRGB color gamut (around 46-55%, I think), so be careful with photo processing. The screen has a matte surface, so there are NO reflections to speak of.Hardware:That being said, this device is great with high/low temps as well! It doesn't slow down with the cold, and it doesn't throttle when hot. The fans do a great job keeping the laptop cool and preventing throttling, even while gaming. Maybe I should try gaming outside in the sunlight....? Perhaps a future edit is in order.Back on track, the fans are audible while performing CPU-heavy tasks (gaming and video processing), but completely quiet while using simple processes, like web browsing and document editing. In fact, I thought the fans turned off, but I can feel a very slight breeze from the back of the device at all times. For simple tasks, this is actually just fine to use in your lap. The rear vents prevent overheating when used on your lap as well. I do not suggest using it in your lap while gaming.The hinge for the screen is sturdy, and the laptop material feels durable and looks good. The keyboard and wrist-rests get smudges, though. Not too fond with that. It is easy to clean with a microfiber cloth, though, so all is not lost.Now, the not so good (don't worry, the list is short):Battery:The battery is easily the greatest letdown for this computer. For everyday tasks, you can get 3-5hrs of battery life, depending on different factors (fan speed, screen brightness, backlit keyboard settings, speaker volume, etc.). However, when gaming, the battery life TANKS! You might get 1:30hrs if you are lucky. For older titles, these metrics change by a lot. But for Halo, for example, I was at 50% in about 40mins. I imagine that video processing would deliver slightly better results, but not aby too much. Keep your plug handy.Speakers:The speakers are decent. Bass is non-existent, but I did not expect that. The vocals, however, are rather clear. The speakers do provide a stereo experience, with the left and right channels working as intended (great for shooting games to know the origin of bullets and footsteps). I typically use Bluetooth or external speakers, so I don't have too many complaints about this.Conclusion:This laptop is a very solid performer for whatever tasks that you want to do, but be mindful of the battery limitations. Keeping this in mind, you won't regret this purchase!",Very fast computer  with mediocre battery life,2023-06-19,5.0,RJPS27EA0F9I9,jesus soto,3.0,"After using the computer for 1 month and a half, it began to show failures. on the screen. and I call for the guarantee and they answer me that I have no way to change it.

Be patient with the loading because it takes maybe 4-5 minutes for it to load all the games and there are a lot.Audio/Picture Quality: On a few of them the audio and picture quality is a little bit distorted and the controllers lag a bit but that should be expected when converting 80's and 90's system games to fit our flat screens.Other Game Features: I love the fact that you can save your game progress and play later.

If that's something that'd be of interest to you, you may be interest in this. It's relatively cheap, and is fun.That said, it's not without flaws –There are numerous duplicates on the game list, so there's nowhere near the 500 games advertised. That's only kind of a bad thing, because the interface for scrolling through the games is slow and inconvenient, so you'll be glad you're not really going through 500 games. (There are a lot of games I'd never heard of on the list, but still a good number of old favorites.)I have questions about the legality of this thing. Even if we're too assume Nintendo has licensed use of Super Mario Brothers, I seriously doubt they licensed ""Mario 16"" which is a reskin of Joe & Mac replacing those characters with Mario, who's fighting dinosaurs.Despite the Game Boy like appearance, the game list skews heavily toward classic console games rather than handheld games. Which means the games you expect to play on a thing that looks like a Game Boy may not be there, but also means that some of the games aren't designed for a screen that small. I had trouble playing Contra because I couldn't always see the bullets coming at me on some of the screens.The instructions are only in Chinese, meaning there was some trial and error in figuring the controls out; they weren't always intuitive.My review is based solely on using it as a standalone handheld. I haven't tried the second controller and TV connection, because I don't have an easy way of connecting an RCA plug to any of my TVs. If your TVs are fairly new, you'll likely have the same issue.","Cheap Fun, and That's About It",2023-03-19,3.0

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either. It's helping to ease the pain of not being able to find a ps5 anywhere at the moment.",It gets a meh,2021-01-12,3.0

I will most likely buy another one.Set Up/Installation: At first I didn't think that it worked at all but I figured out that you have to choose the ""PC"" input option regardless if you are using it on your tv or laptop for it to play. The buttons on top of the controllers help to navigate the menu. Be patient with the loading because it takes maybe 4-5 minutes for it to load all the games and there are a lot.Audio/Picture Quality: On a few of them the audio and picture quality is a little bit distorted and the controllers lag a bit but that should be expected when converting 80's and 90's system games to fit our flat screens.Other Game Features: I love the fact that you can save your game progress and play later. Use the ""Search"" feature, it will save you a lot of time with having to go through the long list of games.My Favorite Games I Found: Teen Mutant Ninja Turtles, Wolverine, Super Mario Brothers 1-3, Mortal Kombat, Excite Bike, Galaga, Contra, and Jackal.","""Love This Game!""",2023-06-23,4.0,RDLHH0M7AWBFB,caesar cayabyab,3.0,There are a LOT of games on this console but it all depends on the downloaded firmware on the stick. 1 version has all the Chinese and Japanese versions of the downloaded games the other has the USA released games and some of the Japanese and Chinese versions of the games. So you might get the game(s) you want but if you can’t read Japanese or Chinese you’d be effed in the “A”I’m wondering if there was a way to download the games onto the stick by attaching it to your PC.

If that's something that'd be of interest to you, you may be interest in this. It's relatively cheap, and is fun.That said, it's not without flaws –There are numerous duplicates on the game list, so there's nowhere near the 500 games advertised. That's only kind of a bad thing, because the interface for scrolling through the games is slow and inconvenient, so you'll be glad you're not really going through 500 games. (There are a lot of games I'd never heard of on the list, but still a good number of old favorites.)I have questions about the legality of this thing. Even if we're too assume Nintendo has licensed use of Super Mario Brothers, I seriously doubt they licensed ""Mario 16"" which is a reskin of Joe & Mac replacing those characters with Mario, who's fighting dinosaurs.Despite the Game Boy like appearance, the game list skews heavily toward classic console games rather than handheld games. Which means the games you expect to play on a thing that looks like a Game Boy may not be there, but also means that some of the games aren't designed for a screen that small. I had trouble playing Contra because I couldn't always see the bullets coming at me on some of the screens.The instructions are only in Chinese, meaning there was some trial and error in figuring the controls out; they weren't always intuitive.My review is based solely on using it as a standalone handheld. I haven't tried the second controller and TV connection, because I don't have an easy way of connecting an RCA plug to any of my TVs. If your TVs are fairly new, you'll likely have the same issue.","Cheap Fun, and That's About It",2023-03-19,3.0

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either.

For that reason, I've added one more star!",STUCK with ITS CONTROLLERS,2022-11-23,4.0,R1AL2FUWACCNTU,S. McGrath,1.0,"This is most definitely not for beginners at all. It is extremely complicated to figure out. After weeks of research, I am very confident that it does not have Android on it. It has an auto save function that seems to work on 8 & 16 bit games. Like NES & SNES. But it doesn't seem to work on Playstation games. The controller often needs to be mapped. And no matter what you do, it doesn't work properly for certain games or systems. For example Dreamcast Sonic is not playable. Because the directional pads do not work. You cannot make Sonic move. I literally downloaded every version of Sonic for Dreamcast I could find. Same result. So I bought different controllers. None of the controllers I bought would pair to the system. It would say it was connected, but it didn't work. So I wasted money on different controllers. It says it has 45+ emulators? Sure, but a lot of them are things like the Commodore 64. Which is essentially a very old computer system that requires a keyboard. This emulator doesn't have a keyboard. So I can't play those even if I wanted to. Wants me to type in a command. Not gonna do it. Can't. And a lot of the systems are handheld systems. Game boy, Game Boy color, Game Boy advance, Nintendo ds, Neo Geo pocket, Neo Geo Pocket color, Game Gear. Speaking of the game gear, it does have every Sega system from the Master System to genesis, 32x, Sega cd, Sega saturn, and of course the dreamcast. With Nintendo you're going to get regular nes, snes, Nintendo 64, and that's it. I'm kind of surprised there was no GameCube. The N64 did not have Donkey Kong 64. That kind of surprised me. I had to install it myself. Which brings me to the SD card. They pretty much maxed it out. So even though you can add stuff to the SD card, you're very limited. You're going to get the original PlayStation and nothing else. I'm surprised there was no original Xbox. For the most part, I find the PlayStation games tend to work pretty good. Before example, I was playing Crash Bandicoot and I beat several levels and when I went back to it the next time it had not saved anything. I almost want to return this. But then I think to myself screw it. At least I can play these games if I wanted to. It's better than nothing. It would be a lot cooler if you could actually save your place. For example, I have an old Arcade NES emulator. And I also have a SNES emulator. The SNES also does NES. Either one of these systems, if you press select and start at the same time, it brings up your save, load, or quit menu. And it will allow you to literally save whatever spot you are in those games. Which is absolutely wonderful for something like the original Mario game. Because not only can you start where you left off, you can load different lives and different locations. With multiple saves in each game. I was really hoping this system would do the same thing. One last thing. On the box, it does say that it has android. When it absolutely does not. On the box, It also says that the system itself has no system. This thing comes with two USB ports. One USB port is for your controllers. Both controllers will work with the One USB dongle. The other USB port is for a USB to SD card adapter. You plug in your SD card to the USB adapter dongle. And then you plug that into the system. Without that, there is no system. The entire operating system is on that micros. And the game box itself does not even have a MicroSD input natively. I found that very odd. After doing some research it appears that this system is actually a banana pie. Which is a cheaper raspberry pi. But even most cheap banana pies actually have a MicroSD slot input. So I'm not sure why they did this. Almost all emulator systems have a slot built in for an SD card.",Claims to have Android 9.1 but does not.,2023-06-12,2.0

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either.

There's no HDMI cable needed since the device plugs directly into the back of your TV.It came preloaded with several games on the game card it came with, and setup was pretty easy to do. It was for the most part plug and play. Most of the games worked fine on it, but there were some that had some weird graphical glitches going on with them. This system covers all the old games and systems from when video games practically first started, all the up to about the SNES era. It had all the Retro/Classic games that I was interested in revisiting from that era!Overall, I'd give this 4 stars. It does work, it comes with lots of games, and the price is comparable to similar systems. I pulled a point since some of the games have visual glitches in them, whereas other similar systems didn't present the same issues with the same games.

My family and I enjoyed hours of playing our favorite throwback games. In my opinion, I think that it was worth the price. I will most likely buy another one.Set Up/Installation: At first I didn't think that it worked at all but I figured out that you have to choose the ""PC"" input option regardless if you are using it on your tv or laptop for it to play. The buttons on top of the controllers help to navigate the menu. Be patient with the loading because it takes maybe 4-5 minutes for it to load all the games and there are a lot.Audio/Picture Quality: On a few of them the audio and picture quality is a little bit distorted and the controllers lag a bit but that should be expected when converting 80's and 90's system games to fit our flat screens.Other Game Features: I love the fact that you can save your game progress and play later. Use the ""Search"" feature, it will save you a lot of time with having to go through the long list of games.My Favorite Games I Found: Teen Mutant Ninja Turtles, Wolverine, Super Mario Brothers 1-3, Mortal Kombat, Excite Bike, Galaga, Contra, and Jackal.","""Love This Game!""",2023-06-23,4.0,RDLHH0M7AWBFB,caesar cayabyab,3.0,There are a LOT of games on this console but it all depends on the downloaded firmware on the stick. 1 version has all the Chinese and Japanese versions of the downloaded games the other has the USA released games and some of the Japanese and Chinese versions of the games. So you might get the game(s) you want but if you can’t read Japanese or Chinese you’d be effed in the “A”I’m wondering if there was a way to download the games onto the stick by attaching it to your PC.

If that's something that'd be of interest to you, you may be interest in this. It's relatively cheap, and is fun.That said, it's not without flaws –There are numerous duplicates on the game list, so there's nowhere near the 500 games advertised. That's only kind of a bad thing, because the interface for scrolling through the games is slow and inconvenient, so you'll be glad you're not really going through 500 games. (There are a lot of games I'd never heard of on the list, but still a good number of old favorites.)I have questions about the legality of this thing. Even if we're too assume Nintendo has licensed use of Super Mario Brothers, I seriously doubt they licensed ""Mario 16"" which is a reskin of Joe & Mac replacing those characters with Mario, who's fighting dinosaurs.Despite the Game Boy like appearance, the game list skews heavily toward classic console games rather than handheld games. Which means the games you expect to play on a thing that looks like a Game Boy may not be there, but also means that some of the games aren't designed for a screen that small. I had trouble playing Contra because I couldn't always see the bullets coming at me on some of the screens.The instructions are only in Chinese, meaning there was some trial and error in figuring the controls out; they weren't always intuitive.My review is based solely on using it as a standalone handheld. I haven't tried the second controller and TV connection, because I don't have an easy way of connecting an RCA plug to any of my TVs. If your TVs are fairly new, you'll likely have the same issue.","Cheap Fun, and That's About It",2023-03-19,3.0

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either. It's helping to ease the pain of not being able to find a ps5 anywhere at the moment.",It gets a meh,2021-01-12,3.0

For that reason, I've added one more star!",STUCK with ITS CONTROLLERS,2022-11-23,4.0,R1AL2FUWACCNTU,S. McGrath,1.0,"This is most definitely not for beginners at all. It is extremely complicated to figure out. After weeks of research, I am very confident that it does not have Android on it. It has an auto save function that seems to work on 8 & 16 bit games. Like NES & SNES. But it doesn't seem to work on Playstation games. The controller often needs to be mapped. And no matter what you do, it doesn't work properly for certain games or systems. For example Dreamcast Sonic is not playable. Because the directional pads do not work. You cannot make Sonic move. I literally downloaded every version of Sonic for Dreamcast I could find. Same result. So I bought different controllers. None of the controllers I bought would pair to the system. It would say it was connected, but it didn't work. So I wasted money on different controllers. It says it has 45+ emulators? Sure, but a lot of them are things like the Commodore 64. Which is essentially a very old computer system that requires a keyboard. This emulator doesn't have a keyboard. So I can't play those even if I wanted to. Wants me to type in a command. Not gonna do it. Can't. And a lot of the systems are handheld systems. Game boy, Game Boy color, Game Boy advance, Nintendo ds, Neo Geo pocket, Neo Geo Pocket color, Game Gear. Speaking of the game gear, it does have every Sega system from the Master System to genesis, 32x, Sega cd, Sega saturn, and of course the dreamcast. With Nintendo you're going to get regular nes, snes, Nintendo 64, and that's it. I'm kind of surprised there was no GameCube. The N64 did not have Donkey Kong 64. That kind of surprised me. I had to install it myself. Which brings me to the SD card. They pretty much maxed it out. So even though you can add stuff to the SD card, you're very limited. You're going to get the original PlayStation and nothing else. I'm surprised there was no original Xbox. For the most part, I find the PlayStation games tend to work pretty good. Before example, I was playing Crash Bandicoot and I beat several levels and when I went back to it the next time it had not saved anything. I almost want to return this. But then I think to myself screw it. At least I can play these games if I wanted to. It's better than nothing. It would be a lot cooler if you could actually save your place. For example, I have an old Arcade NES emulator. And I also have a SNES emulator. The SNES also does NES. Either one of these systems, if you press select and start at the same time, it brings up your save, load, or quit menu. And it will allow you to literally save whatever spot you are in those games. Which is absolutely wonderful for something like the original Mario game. Because not only can you start where you left off, you can load different lives and different locations. With multiple saves in each game. I was really hoping this system would do the same thing. One last thing. On the box, it does say that it has android. When it absolutely does not. On the box, It also says that the system itself has no system. This thing comes with two USB ports. One USB port is for your controllers. Both controllers will work with the One USB dongle. The other USB port is for a USB to SD card adapter. You plug in your SD card to the USB adapter dongle. And then you plug that into the system. Without that, there is no system. The entire operating system is on that micros. And the game box itself does not even have a MicroSD input natively. I found that very odd. After doing some research it appears that this system is actually a banana pie. Which is a cheaper raspberry pi. But even most cheap banana pies actually have a MicroSD slot input. So I'm not sure why they did this. Almost all emulator systems have a slot built in for an SD card.",Claims to have Android 9.1 but does not.,2023-06-12,2.0

(2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either.

It’s actually a pretty darn good book, even cool in parts. It has its flaws, but when you compare it to others out there, it definitely holds its own.Before I go any further, I should to let you know where I’m coming from. I have been playing games for decades, both board games and computer games. I’m not one to spend all my time gaming, but I have spent months trying to get to the end of a computer game. “Riven,” the second of the “Myst” series, comes to mind. Also “BioShock.” I am not a game developer. I am an author. I write fiction, screenplays and non-fiction, but mostly novels and books on how to write novels. I have written on storytelling as a subject independent of genre.So I’m an author and a gamer, while Evan Skolnick is a gamer and has been a game developer for decades. He gives seminars at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Game creators struggle with how to integrate narrative storytelling into the action of a game so that it provides a richer and more complete experience for the player. Skolnick wrote this book to help developers more fully understand the art of narrative storytelling in video games. I read his book not to critique it but to learn something about storytelling in games. And it taught me quite a lot. I was not disappointed. The book’s subtitle is “What every Developer Needs to Know About Narrative Techniques.” This is the heart of the matter: how to integrate games and storytelling.The book is divided into two parts, the first titled “Basic Training” is more about storytelling elements themselves: conflict, structure, character and arcs, etc. These are the elements of storytelling as applied to game creation. The second part is titled “In the Trenches.” Here Skolnick gets down to describing the mechanics of actual game development, including the composition and function of the team, all the while paying particular attention to how the story comes together as the game progresses, and how each element of the team makes that happen. This is great stuff.But here come my quibbles. The good news is that Skolnick fully understands that the engine that drives any story is conflict. Without conflict, you have no story. Hollywood screenwriters understand this better than do novelists, but game creators revel in open unabashed conflict, sometimes to its detriment. The problem comes in Chapter 2 when Skolnick discusses “The Three-Act Structure,” (page 15) which was first identified by Aristotle. Skolnick interprets the first plot point as the beginning of confrontation, i.e., the beginning of the conflict. Here’s how he describes the first act:“The audiences of other story-based media — novels, movies, comic books, and plays — come into the experience with a certain degree of patience. They’re willing to spend some time up front getting familiar with the world and characters before the main conflict is introduced and the story really gets going.” [page 21]This just quite simply is not true. Skolnick goes on:“While traditional story audiences regularly tolerate 25 percent or more of the total story time being devoted to initial setup…” [page 21]How he could be so wrong about this and it could escape the attention of his editors is beyond me. In traditional story structure, the conflict is locked as soon as possible, very close to the beginning. The first plot point is when the central conflict takes off in a new direction, perhaps a dramatic escalation or an expansion of the scope of the conflict. So the central conflict is actually locked at the beginning of Act I and is dramatically escalated at the beginning of Act II. No one would wait until 1/4 of the way through the story to start the confrontation. Here’s the opening on E.B. White’s “Charlotte’s Webb,” a children’s book:""Where's Papa going with that ax?"" said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.""Out to the hoghouse,"" replied Mrs. Arable. ""Some pigs were born last night.""Fern is out the door in a flash to stop her papa, and the story is off at a dead run. Furthermore, in the opening three pages of Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code,” an albino murders the curator of the Louvre Museum in Paris locking the conflict that unfolds at a break-neck pace that is only resolved at the end. I realize that not all novels are structured this way, but neither are all video games. And as for movies, here’s what Irwin R. Blacker says in his book, “The Elements of Screenwriting”:“Conflict is the essence of narrative film. In the opening minutes of a film, two or more forces come into opposition. In film terms, the conflict is ‘locked’ as quickly as possible. So urgent is the need to lock the conflict that many films do so in the tease before the title and credits.” [page 7]Skolnick has not done his homework on narrative storytelling.Whatever Skolnick’s misconceptions about plot point 1, he fully understands plot point 2, which occurs 3/4 of the way through the story. Here’s what he says about it:“Plot Point 2 separates Acts II and III, and is sometimes a bit fuzzier. Generally it’s the moment in which the Hero, battered by the effort of already overcoming so many challenging obstacles, finally sees the path to victory. She hasn’t achieved it yet, and the outcome could still go either way, but the Hero has had some kind of epiphany and at last knows what she needs to do — if she can only pull it off!” [page 16]This is a profound statement about plot point 2, and this paragraph alone makes the book worth reading. To his credit, Skolnick also understands the biggest problem with the three-act structure: mid-story sag. Here is his comment on the subject and his solution:“Act II is usually about twice the length of either of the other acts — it’s big! So big, in fact, that it sometimes gets hard to handle when it comes to structure, planning, and pacing. A writer can start wandering in Act II and lose momentum quite easily. Because of this, many writing gurus split Act II into halves, separated by a Midpoint — the halfway point not only of the act, but also of the overall story — at which time things will often spin in a new direction.” [page 14]This is extraordinarily insightful, and you can see this midpoint as a “reversal of action” in many movies. For example, in “Jaws” the shark hunts the people for the first half of the movie, and the people hunt the shark in the second half. In Cameron’s “Titanic,” the ship floats in the first half, hits the iceberg in the midpoint and sinks during the second half. Many novelists and movie makers don’t have this insight, but Skolnick nails it.My other problem with Skolnick’s discussion in Chapter 2 is that he seems to believe that the protagonist (generally the player of the game) is always there to resolve a conflict that was locked long before the player arrived. Granted, many stories are of this nature. “Star Wars” is one. “Riven” is another. Even “BioShock” fits that format. But what Skolnick is suggesting is that it’s always the same setup. This may be true of current video game development, but it doesn’t have to be that way in the future. The conflict doesn’t have to have a backstory. The relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist can be simpatico at first but rapidly deteriorate into a prolonged conflict. All authors know this. I’m not sure why the gaming community would have such a narrow view of the central conflict.Skolnick focuses on what storytellers from other disciplines (novel writing, screenwriting, playwrighting) can tell game developers, but it’s also obvious that game developers have a lot to offer authors. What I’m thinking of has to do with environments and how they can help tell the story, particularly the backstory. It isn’t something that authors don’t already know, but the degree to which game developers concentrate on letting the environment tell part of the story really is an eyeopener. After all, game developers can’t get away with sketching a few images of a setting. They have to present it in all its glory as continuous visual images from many different angles. They expect the player to spend time roaming the landscape viewing the scenery and perhaps solving a puzzle or two. The environment must be interactive. An author can get away with only describing the salient features of a character’s appearance, but a game developer has to show the complete character, plus the way the characters move. This is pure choreography.I could write a book about this book. It’s that interesting. As I’ve already stated, it isn’t perfect, but it goes a long ways down the road to explaining narrative technique in video game storytelling. A lot of people could benefit from reading it, and they aren’t all game developers.","Excellent, But with a Problem or Two",2015-01-29,4.0,R1A0PL6GLOC267,aasdasdasdasdasdasdasdads,0.0,"Star wars fans are absolutely insufferable and they work their obsession into every facet of their lives.

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either.

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

Be patient with the loading because it takes maybe 4-5 minutes for it to load all the games and there are a lot.Audio/Picture Quality: On a few of them the audio and picture quality is a little bit distorted and the controllers lag a bit but that should be expected when converting 80's and 90's system games to fit our flat screens.Other Game Features: I love the fact that you can save your game progress and play later.

If that's something that'd be of interest to you, you may be interest in this. It's relatively cheap, and is fun.That said, it's not without flaws –There are numerous duplicates on the game list, so there's nowhere near the 500 games advertised. That's only kind of a bad thing, because the interface for scrolling through the games is slow and inconvenient, so you'll be glad you're not really going through 500 games. (There are a lot of games I'd never heard of on the list, but still a good number of old favorites.)I have questions about the legality of this thing. Even if we're too assume Nintendo has licensed use of Super Mario Brothers, I seriously doubt they licensed ""Mario 16"" which is a reskin of Joe & Mac replacing those characters with Mario, who's fighting dinosaurs.Despite the Game Boy like appearance, the game list skews heavily toward classic console games rather than handheld games. Which means the games you expect to play on a thing that looks like a Game Boy may not be there, but also means that some of the games aren't designed for a screen that small. I had trouble playing Contra because I couldn't always see the bullets coming at me on some of the screens.The instructions are only in Chinese, meaning there was some trial and error in figuring the controls out; they weren't always intuitive.My review is based solely on using it as a standalone handheld. I haven't tried the second controller and TV connection, because I don't have an easy way of connecting an RCA plug to any of my TVs. If your TVs are fairly new, you'll likely have the same issue.","Cheap Fun, and That's About It",2023-03-19,3.0

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either. It's helping to ease the pain of not being able to find a ps5 anywhere at the moment.",It gets a meh,2021-01-12,3.0

It is extremely complicated to figure out. After weeks of research, I am very confident that it does not have Android on it. It has an auto save function that seems to work on 8 & 16 bit games. Like NES & SNES. But it doesn't seem to work on Playstation games. The controller often needs to be mapped. And no matter what you do, it doesn't work properly for certain games or systems. For example Dreamcast Sonic is not playable. Because the directional pads do not work. You cannot make Sonic move. I literally downloaded every version of Sonic for Dreamcast I could find. Same result. So I bought different controllers. None of the controllers I bought would pair to the system. It would say it was connected, but it didn't work. So I wasted money on different controllers. It says it has 45+ emulators? Sure, but a lot of them are things like the Commodore 64. Which is essentially a very old computer system that requires a keyboard. This emulator doesn't have a keyboard. So I can't play those even if I wanted to. Wants me to type in a command. Not gonna do it. Can't. And a lot of the systems are handheld systems. Game boy, Game Boy color, Game Boy advance, Nintendo ds, Neo Geo pocket, Neo Geo Pocket color, Game Gear. Speaking of the game gear, it does have every Sega system from the Master System to genesis, 32x, Sega cd, Sega saturn, and of course the dreamcast. With Nintendo you're going to get regular nes, snes, Nintendo 64, and that's it. I'm kind of surprised there was no GameCube. The N64 did not have Donkey Kong 64. That kind of surprised me. I had to install it myself. Which brings me to the SD card. They pretty much maxed it out. So even though you can add stuff to the SD card, you're very limited. You're going to get the original PlayStation and nothing else. I'm surprised there was no original Xbox. For the most part, I find the PlayStation games tend to work pretty good. Before example, I was playing Crash Bandicoot and I beat several levels and when I went back to it the next time it had not saved anything. I almost want to return this. But then I think to myself screw it. At least I can play these games if I wanted to. It's better than nothing. It would be a lot cooler if you could actually save your place. For example, I have an old Arcade NES emulator. And I also have a SNES emulator. The SNES also does NES. Either one of these systems, if you press select and start at the same time, it brings up your save, load, or quit menu. And it will allow you to literally save whatever spot you are in those games. Which is absolutely wonderful for something like the original Mario game. Because not only can you start where you left off, you can load different lives and different locations. With multiple saves in each game. I was really hoping this system would do the same thing. One last thing. On the box, it does say that it has android. When it absolutely does not. On the box, It also says that the system itself has no system. This thing comes with two USB ports. One USB port is for your controllers. Both controllers will work with the One USB dongle. The other USB port is for a USB to SD card adapter. You plug in your SD card to the USB adapter dongle. And then you plug that into the system. Without that, there is no system. The entire operating system is on that micros. And the game box itself does not even have a MicroSD input natively. I found that very odd. After doing some research it appears that this system is actually a banana pie. Which is a cheaper raspberry pi. But even most cheap banana pies actually have a MicroSD slot input.

The same issue with the joysticks, but I knew that ahead of time and plan on replacing them.I want to give an A++ to this seller. I have never had an Amazon seller be so responsive and work with the customer. The seller has been outstanding to work with and communicates and responds very quickly.  Everything about this experience, except for the joysticks, has been great. So, I am upping my star rating to 5 stars...because the joystick issue is an easy fix for me.UPDATE ON THIS UNIT: First, the joysticks that come with this are not very good. So, I spent an additional $30 on a SANWA JLF-TP-8YT Original Joystick. Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

This system is OK. Most of the old school fighting games are there and playable. If you want to play street fighter, king of fighters, or other similar old school arcade games, this system will facilitate that without too many issues. If you want to play anything like mortal kombat or NBA jams, then be prepared to be disappointed. The frame rate on those games is horrible and makes those games unplayable. The game count is significantly over rated. There are several copies of at least a dozen games in the game list. The same game may show up over 10 times in different parts of the list. Some are named incorrectly also.Bottom line; if you're looking for this to perfectly play all the included games, or have a full list over 3000 games, you'll be disappointed.  If you want to finally beat that frustrating quarter hog of an arcade game that you never had a chance to in the arcade due to a lack of funds... this is the one. I was able to go through some of the old flying/ shooting games that would've taken $10 or more in quarters to attempt and finished them for the first time. For me, this checks off a couple to do's from a few decades ago.Overall I give it a meh... definitely not all that is advertised as, but not completely disappointing either.

It’s actually a pretty darn good book, even cool in parts. It has its flaws, but when you compare it to others out there, it definitely holds its own.Before I go any further, I should to let you know where I’m coming from. I have been playing games for decades, both board games and computer games. I’m not one to spend all my time gaming, but I have spent months trying to get to the end of a computer game. “Riven,” the second of the “Myst” series, comes to mind. Also “BioShock.” I am not a game developer. I am an author. I write fiction, screenplays and non-fiction, but mostly novels and books on how to write novels. I have written on storytelling as a subject independent of genre.So I’m an author and a gamer, while Evan Skolnick is a gamer and has been a game developer for decades. He gives seminars at the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Game creators struggle with how to integrate narrative storytelling into the action of a game so that it provides a richer and more complete experience for the player. Skolnick wrote this book to help developers more fully understand the art of narrative storytelling in video games. I read his book not to critique it but to learn something about storytelling in games. And it taught me quite a lot. I was not disappointed. The book’s subtitle is “What every Developer Needs to Know About Narrative Techniques.” This is the heart of the matter: how to integrate games and storytelling.The book is divided into two parts, the first titled “Basic Training” is more about storytelling elements themselves: conflict, structure, character and arcs, etc. These are the elements of storytelling as applied to game creation. The second part is titled “In the Trenches.” Here Skolnick gets down to describing the mechanics of actual game development, including the composition and function of the team, all the while paying particular attention to how the story comes together as the game progresses, and how each element of the team makes that happen. This is great stuff.But here come my quibbles. The good news is that Skolnick fully understands that the engine that drives any story is conflict. Without conflict, you have no story. Hollywood screenwriters understand this better than do novelists, but game creators revel in open unabashed conflict, sometimes to its detriment. The problem comes in Chapter 2 when Skolnick discusses “The Three-Act Structure,” (page 15) which was first identified by Aristotle. Skolnick interprets the first plot point as the beginning of confrontation, i.e., the beginning of the conflict. Here’s how he describes the first act:“The audiences of other story-based media — novels, movies, comic books, and plays — come into the experience with a certain degree of patience. They’re willing to spend some time up front getting familiar with the world and characters before the main conflict is introduced and the story really gets going.” [page 21]This just quite simply is not true. Skolnick goes on:“While traditional story audiences regularly tolerate 25 percent or more of the total story time being devoted to initial setup…” [page 21]How he could be so wrong about this and it could escape the attention of his editors is beyond me. In traditional story structure, the conflict is locked as soon as possible, very close to the beginning. The first plot point is when the central conflict takes off in a new direction, perhaps a dramatic escalation or an expansion of the scope of the conflict. So the central conflict is actually locked at the beginning of Act I and is dramatically escalated at the beginning of Act II. No one would wait until 1/4 of the way through the story to start the confrontation. Here’s the opening on E.B. White’s “Charlotte’s Webb,” a children’s book:""Where's Papa going with that ax?"" said Fern to her mother as they were setting the table for breakfast.""Out to the hoghouse,"" replied Mrs. Arable. ""Some pigs were born last night.""Fern is out the door in a flash to stop her papa, and the story is off at a dead run. Furthermore, in the opening three pages of Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code,” an albino murders the curator of the Louvre Museum in Paris locking the conflict that unfolds at a break-neck pace that is only resolved at the end. I realize that not all novels are structured this way, but neither are all video games. And as for movies, here’s what Irwin R. Blacker says in his book, “The Elements of Screenwriting”:“Conflict is the essence of narrative film. In the opening minutes of a film, two or more forces come into opposition. In film terms, the conflict is ‘locked’ as quickly as possible. So urgent is the need to lock the conflict that many films do so in the tease before the title and credits.” [page 7]Skolnick has not done his homework on narrative storytelling.Whatever Skolnick’s misconceptions about plot point 1, he fully understands plot point 2, which occurs 3/4 of the way through the story. Here’s what he says about it:“Plot Point 2 separates Acts II and III, and is sometimes a bit fuzzier. Generally it’s the moment in which the Hero, battered by the effort of already overcoming so many challenging obstacles, finally sees the path to victory. She hasn’t achieved it yet, and the outcome could still go either way, but the Hero has had some kind of epiphany and at last knows what she needs to do — if she can only pull it off!” [page 16]This is a profound statement about plot point 2, and this paragraph alone makes the book worth reading. To his credit, Skolnick also understands the biggest problem with the three-act structure: mid-story sag. Here is his comment on the subject and his solution:“Act II is usually about twice the length of either of the other acts — it’s big! So big, in fact, that it sometimes gets hard to handle when it comes to structure, planning, and pacing. A writer can start wandering in Act II and lose momentum quite easily. Because of this, many writing gurus split Act II into halves, separated by a Midpoint — the halfway point not only of the act, but also of the overall story — at which time things will often spin in a new direction.” [page 14]This is extraordinarily insightful, and you can see this midpoint as a “reversal of action” in many movies. For example, in “Jaws” the shark hunts the people for the first half of the movie, and the people hunt the shark in the second half. In Cameron’s “Titanic,” the ship floats in the first half, hits the iceberg in the midpoint and sinks during the second half. Many novelists and movie makers don’t have this insight, but Skolnick nails it.My other problem with Skolnick’s discussion in Chapter 2 is that he seems to believe that the protagonist (generally the player of the game) is always there to resolve a conflict that was locked long before the player arrived. Granted, many stories are of this nature. “Star Wars” is one. “Riven” is another. Even “BioShock” fits that format. But what Skolnick is suggesting is that it’s always the same setup. This may be true of current video game development, but it doesn’t have to be that way in the future. The conflict doesn’t have to have a backstory. The relationship between the protagonist and the antagonist can be simpatico at first but rapidly deteriorate into a prolonged conflict. All authors know this. I’m not sure why the gaming community would have such a narrow view of the central conflict.Skolnick focuses on what storytellers from other disciplines (novel writing, screenwriting, playwrighting) can tell game developers, but it’s also obvious that game developers have a lot to offer authors. What I’m thinking of has to do with environments and how they can help tell the story, particularly the backstory. It isn’t something that authors don’t already know, but the degree to which game developers concentrate on letting the environment tell part of the story really is an eyeopener. After all, game developers can’t get away with sketching a few images of a setting. They have to present it in all its glory as continuous visual images from many different angles. They expect the player to spend time roaming the landscape viewing the scenery and perhaps solving a puzzle or two. The environment must be interactive. An author can get away with only describing the salient features of a character’s appearance, but a game developer has to show the complete character, plus the way the characters move. This is pure choreography.I could write a book about this book. It’s that interesting. As I’ve already stated, it isn’t perfect, but it goes a long ways down the road to explaining narrative technique in video game storytelling. A lot of people could benefit from reading it, and they aren’t all game developers.","Excellent, But with a Problem or Two",2015-01-29,4.0,R1A0PL6GLOC267,aasdasdasdasdasdasdasdads,0.0,"Star wars fans are absolutely insufferable and they work their obsession into every facet of their lives.

They worked on Star wars games most notably, one of which he says it was canceled. What do you do after that, write a book?If you read the forward they are very clear they don't want to talk about video games and they'd rather talk about Star Wars.Every topic begins with a very dumbed down example or analogy that is totally excess.I was hoping for a guide with very straightforward information and not having to read through somebody's analogy about Corvettes and mustangs gas in the tank and how it is somehow an analog to storytelling.The last thing I was expecting was to have the stage set by a Star wars fan that they're going to talk more about Star wars than video game narratives.

Link here from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CRQMWEQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI installed this joystick and now the unit is absolutely perfect. Seriously, this is like playing the arcade game now. If you get any variation of this console...I highly recommend you at least change out the main joystick with this SANWA joystick...you will not regret it.----------------------------------------------------------------------I would have given it 5 stars, if it had better joysticks! (2 stars for bad joysticks)I have one of the expensive HyperSpin builds with an X-Arcade Tank Stick joystick/trackball combo, that I've had for years. I wanted something that was ""all in one"" and didn't require a separate computer to run on. So, I did a lot of research and digging and came up with this 13,000 game non-WiFi Pandora 30s console.First off, let me say, what the 30s means, I have no clue, but to my surprise, when my console arrived, mine is the 40s, I assume that is newer.Pros:I absolutely love this console! It has every retro game I can remember playing as a kid and many that I had forgotten about. If you want a simple, ""all in one"" box, this is it. The games all play very well...I hadn't noticed any tearing, lag, or slow downs of any kind...it just works and plays.CONS:THE JOYSTICKS ON THIS BOX ARE TERRIBLE...LOL! They do work and you can play ALL games with them, but when you get serious and need to make that perfect move, at the perfect time, these will not handle it. To test this out, try playing Pac-Man, you simply cannot navigate quick enough.Yes, the seller has suggested hooking up a USB controller...but that is NOT why I purchased this ""all in one"" box. I want the True Arcade Joystick play, not using a PS2 controller.I paid $159.00 for this 13,000 game unit. Was it worth it...YES! Would I recommend it...YES! Is it fun...YES! Does it bring back memories as a kid...YES, YES YES!Again, the ONLY real negative I can give this is the joysticks. I may look into getting some better joysticks and swap them out. These are no where near the quality of joysticks that are in the X-Arcade Tank Stick, but also look at the cost there as well. This box doesn't require a computer to run. It is simply ""plug and play"" and that's exactly what I wanted, minus the bad joysticks :)Again, the included joysticks will play all games you want to play, but they will also get you killed in a tight turn, jump, or move. Bummer there.","Great little Arcade system, with not so great joysticks. (UPDATED JOYSTICK & A++ Customer Service)",2022-09-18,5.0,R1F01CO16AY21,Amazon Customer,14.0,"When I bought this unit, I was looking to scratch my nostalgic itch for videogames of the 80s and 90s. From that perspective, this product worked! Lots of games, plenty of entertainment potential.But then, all the issues began to pop up. First, the unit does not always power up. When it doesn’t, it makes a funny humming noise, almost like it’s trying to start, but can’t. After it’s finally on (sometimes after 5-10 minutes, sometime I’d just give up), the unit kept resetting itself, even mid-game. For every 30 min of play time, I would have to deal with one or two resets. Very annoying. That alone made playing impractical.Second, the built-in speaker is a hassle, not a desirable feature. The sound quality is mediocre — which is fine, I’d want to run the sound through the TV anyways. But if you lower the volume on the speaker, the volume on the TV goes down too! Well, turn off the built-in speaker, right? That option was unavailable in the settings. So, I either played without sound or with the little speaker blasting for all in the room to hear.Third, and maybe this is just user error, I could not change the screen setting to fit the picture better on my 42-inch, 16:9 format TV. The image fits horizontally and chops the top and bottom of the game screen. In addition to losing “screen real estate”, the image gets more pixelated because it needs to expand to fit side-to-side. Playing Outrun was impossible, I couldn’t tell if that giant pixel on the horizon was a car coming, a bush, the beginning of a curve ahead…Fourth, the buttons and directional stick are very “click-y”. This is a personal thing, but I dislike loud buttons that go click-click-click all the time. It’s distracting. The clicks were often louder than the built-in speaker itself.Lastly, I could not make the unit work with my computer monitor. I tried all the connections available, nothing worked.In the end, I had to return the product. I didn’t want to do it, it had potential, but there were just way too many issues to deal with. I spent more time troubleshooting cable connections and surfing the settings menu than actually having fun playing games.Having it at home for 2 weeks made me want to look for a good product, since I really enjoyed the idea of playing some old-school arcade games at home. I guess I’ll need to search a bit more.","I wanted to like it, but…",2022-10-06,2.0

Fr. (RevRev) Rick,0.0,"Game of Thrones Blu-ray setI purchased this set to replace my Season 1-6 and Season 7 and Season 8 DVD sets. In what follows please accept my apology if I have recalled something incorrectly. I found the set excellent and worth the price of admission, but I’d like to describe some “interesting” features of the set.Realize that it is a huge set that includes 33 discs. When my set arrived I found that at least one-third (yes, about a dozen) of the discs were loose in their cases. I don’t know if this occurrence is a comment on the less secure Blu-ray cases (to me, they seem less so than DVD cases), a poor packaging for shipping job, or unusually rough handling during shipping. One corner of the slipcase cover was slightly “accordioned” but not very noticeable. All discs looked fine on inspection and all episodes (I viewed them all) plus all features (that I have viewed this far) have played without error.Obviously the video and audio quality far exceeds the DVD set that I have and that alone (plus having all eight seasons in one enclosed package) was worth the purchase. But read on, if you wish…The weirwood tree animation at boot up of each disc is cute though it sometimes doesn’t get a chance to actually animate each time (your mileage may vary depending on your equipment.) But the momentary static “languages available” image at the start of each disc seems a bit unnecessary and maybe even a little irritating, but perhaps some may need it.Drop down “house banner” menus are neat but they are translucent and so is the text on them so they are not easy to read over the moving video montage that is presented behind them. Also, not a big deal, but they retract after 60 seconds if not acted upon. Of course, you can open a banner again, but don’t be surprised if it disappears after you return from grabbing refreshment.All the original DVD extra bonus features provided are present along with several new features. Most are indeed “behind the scenes” video features, but some are text and still animation images, some are voiced-over by the characters (not sure these were provided by the actors or not) and some are just text you walk through and read. Nice extras but not as good as the bonus video features provided.The extra 3-disc bonus set is excellent with a two-part “Game of Thrones Reunion” feature, Anatomy of a Scene” (for Seasons 4,5,6,7), “Behind the Scenes” (for Seasons 1, 2, 4, 5), “Inside the Visual Effects” (for Seasons 1-7) and “Season 7 Deleted Scenes”. There are similar features scattered throughout the sets and I have not viewed them all…yet.The “Conquest & Rebellion” feature on disc 3 of the Bonus Features set is long (ten chapters) and yet quite interesting, though consisting of slightly animation-enhanced high quality static images and character voice-overs. (Again, perhaps not done by the actors.) Note that once you select a chapter the history continues to play through the following chapters unless you interrupt it (that is, you can’t play “one and done”.) I found it useful to have subtitles on during the feature. It gives a fairly thorough overview of the 300-400 years of history before the Game of Thrones timeline began.Starting with Season 4 and after “Dolby Atmos” audio support is available, although I don’t have the equipment to determine the difference. But the enhanced audio is certainly available. The Bonus Features set does not support Dolby Atmos (who cares?)The ability to walk through the Episodes menu and select any episode from the entire season then be prompted to insert the correct disk if the selected episode is not on the current one is a nice little feature. It is not available on the Season 7 and 8 sets for some reason.I am sure you will enjoy this entire Blu-ray set of Game of Thrones!",Impressive Blu-ray set with MANY bonus features!,2023-09-18,5.0,R3N16PU1IXFGQC,Saint Nicolas Cage,70.0,"First of all, I won't be wasting anyone's time complaining about season 8 (which I haven't even seen yet), or anything else.  This is just a review of the 4K box set.I never got to watch a good deal of GoT, so pretty much everything is going to be new for me!  I only got to see the episodes on my PC, where I was lucky if the videos reached 480p.  I gave up after season one because it just wasn't enjoyable watching them like that.  So when I got my PS5, upgraded my receiver and added Atmos speakers, I started looking into 4K Blu-rays.  Thanks to Films At Home's review on YouTube, I discovered this and I just HAD to have it!The 4K picture quality is phenomenal.  With so much happening in the snow and in the dark, watching this with HDR will blow your mind away!  The Atmos tracks are a very good addition, but not overly impressive (at least not yet, as I'm still in season one), and are still a part of an already an amazing presentation.  The box artwork is great, and the slipcover has an embossed dragon wrapping around the side.Each disc has commentaries, but I've heard some have more than that, and there are 3 bonus Blu-rays of separate special features.  It also includes a code for the digital edition, which expires on December 31st, 2022.  Others here say that theirs had already expired last year, so maybe they've updated it.  Just make sure you realize that the digital copy is only in 1080p, not 4K.  There's also a small booklet with a list of the episodes from each season, and a bit of nice artwork.However, there is one major problem with the set, that I can't believe the designers got away with.  Most seasons each have four discs, but instead of having a swinging tray in the middle, they stacked two discs on top of one another on each side.  Everyone knows that doing this is a HUGE no-no, as it results in discs being damaged, especially when trying to remove them from the spindles.  I highly recommend getting a CD/DVD wallet to put them in right away.  Another problem is that the audio doesn't default to Atmos, even if you have it enabled on your receiver.  You need to go into the audio settings on each disc every time you want to watch one, and switch the playback to Atmos.  Not a huge deal, but it is a little annoying since I don't always think to do that.  Or maybe that's the way it is for everything with Atmos....I'm still fairly new to this.Another problem with the discs I just noticed after putting them into a wallet is how they're labeled.  They're black, with VERY small & dark copper text.  You basically have to hold them up to the light in order to see them.  Not a huge problem, but very bad design.Fortunately, I've learned from past bad experiences with a few box sets that you absolutely must check every disc, not just for scratches or duplicates, but also to make sure they actually can play.  You need to make sure that they can reach the main menu, and maybe even try playing a few seconds of an episode.  It's very time consuming to sit in front of the TV, swapping discs in and out for almost two hours, but it's worth it.  I'm saying all of this because I had to return my first order, as the third disc of season six didn't read at all.  I never would've found that out until after the return period.  From what I've read here, this seems to be a somewhat common problem with this set.  Also, season five's case was smashed on the top right, but those discs were fine.When I got my replacement, I immediately noticed that season one's box doesn't lock at all, and the sheet with the digital code wasn't secured in place like before.  It was loose and bent.  I can't be sure, because I have no need to redeem it, but I have a feeling that someone pulled a fast one and already did.  Also, the first discs of seasons three and four take a very long time to load, but in the end they do work, so I'll be keeping this set since everything else plays fine.All in all, if you're a GoT fan with a 4K Blu-ray player, there's no reason not to get this!  Yes, it's a bit pricey, but it's worth it.  Just don't forget to check the discs.",4K COMPLETE COLLECTION BOX SET REVIEW (NOT EPISODES).,2021-02-13,3.0

It doesn't feel like a burden to read 2+ chapters in a sitting, even for the most hyperactive of children. However, that's the major drawback as well. I do not feel the reading is enough of a challenge. My little one flew through these, remembered little past the first day or so of reading them, and did not develop any skills or even patience.A parent can mitigate these problems somewhat. I started asking my little to tell me what he read after he read it, and his summaries of the chapters were often very funny and a great way to get him thinking about the characters and plots. I also started asking him to spend more time reading in a sitting, since the chapters were so short. I found that by the last book, he could easily read half the novel in one sitting in his favorite chair before getting antsy again.The boxed set is quite colorful and looks good on a child's shelf. It comes with an envelope sealed with a sticker, to be opened only after finishing the final novel. This has a QR code leading to a web announcement video for another novel series, and some bonus material. This gimmick really got my little one into reading to the end, and he was excited to open the envelope. So excited, in fact, that I went and purchased the new series' boxed set right after he finished.The books also contain small activities in the back, ranging from drawing instructions to small quizzes and supplementary info on the book's themes.

It'll play millions of classic games or just about anything you can find a rom for, up to PS1. It does come with a TF card preloaded with some games, and although I do question the legitimacy of this practice, it's worth it just to have a fresh TF card that's already formatted and organized.The buttons feel great, membrane-style as opposed to tactile, but feel great and aren't spongey at all. D-pad is nice and stiff, and the analog stick feels similar to a Switch. The build quality is overall fantastic, the metal shell adds a weighty feel to the unit and feels extremely satisfying to hold. There are volume buttons on the side, but the volume range isn't great. Two notches equal too loud and too soft.There's only two real issues with the hardware that aren't exactly oversights, but something you need to be aware of. There are two TF card slots, the second slot is covered by a sticker and contains the operating system. If you don't plan on loading a new operating system, do NOT remove this card. Without a properly formatted card containing an operating system, the unit will not turn on. If you attempt alternate operating systems, make sure you save the factory TF card and use a new one, just in case anything goes wrong.Second is the charging situation. There's a type c charge cable in the box, but the unit is sensitive to any kind of rapid or fast charging wall adapters (i.e. adapters that come with most phones). You need to make sure you aren't using anything too powerful to charge or else you risk frying the battery. The safest bet would be to use either a computer to charge, or an early 1 amp iPhone power adapter, just something weak. There are 2 type c inputs on the top of the unit but only the one on the left is for charging, the right is for accessories only.

I'll break this review into a few parts.Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing.Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day.Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security — my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here — and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem.Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color.","B on fit, A+ on fabric",2023-08-18,4.0,R33NO5LD7WG99K,Debbie,0.0,"The dress is heavier than I thought it would be.

I’m wearing it to the Jonas Brothers concert and taking it on vacation to Portugal.

I'll break this review into a few parts.Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing.Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day.Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security — my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here — and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem.Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color.","B on fit, A+ on fabric",2023-08-18,4.0,R33NO5LD7WG99K,Debbie,0.0,"The dress is heavier than I thought it would be.

But as you can see, it’s actually more of a true red with blue undertones. In some light, it does look darker but it’s not what I wanted. I then ordered the red, and I’m really happy with it! It’s a warmer red with orange undertones and I think it looks better on my olive skin. The dress itself is very flattering on my body (5’9, 170 lbs, ordered size L, 35” waist but can fit into 31”-36” clothes). The back of the dress is smocked and is overall stretchy and comfortable. The fabric doesn’t feel cheap to me; it’s lightweight and has a nice drape to it. It can definitely be dressed up with nice shoes and jewelry or dresses down with sneakers and a jacket. I’m wearing it to the Jonas Brothers concert and taking it on vacation to Portugal. Oh and it’s much easier to get the straps right when someone else ties them for you, otherwise it’s impossible to get them tight enough/even on both sides.","Lovely versatile dress, but inaccurate color",2023-08-21,4.0,R25XIV2B0VQPLJ,Brenna,0.0,Dress is okay.

It is nearly equal in quality to several other dresses in the exact style and fabric content that I've purchased from Amazon and from another ""major"" retailer.  The fabric is what was described (95%Rayon/5%Spandex) so that the feel, the buttery-softness, the stretch, and the drape are just what I wanted/expected.  It appears well-sewn, too.  My only disappointment is that, while the website  image of this dress makes the colors appear saturated and vivid, they are not the same in person. The reds do not stand out from the teals and aquas so vividly.  And, although I never noticed it in the website image, there is a lot of pale pink in the background ( not sure even if it stands out in my photo) - sort of giving the print a ""washed-out"" look.  I wanted richer teals and richer reds. As for fit, I am a little over 5'7"" and about 220 lbs., 42C.  I normally wear a size 2X or XXL in tops and dresses, and that's what I ordered.  The length for me is well above the knees - but, I intended at the start to wear it as a sort of long tunic over leggings.  So, it's perfect for what I wanted.

Will wear it for church and for special occasions.  The bodice has a snap, two more snaps were provided to secure more of the V neckline; which is good because it is too low for me.  The fabric is delicate though not see through; it is lined on the bodice and has a knee length lining, as well.  The long sleeves are not lined; there is a fabric belt made of the same fabric.  The print is lovely.  This dress has a nice fuller skirt, which will fit curvy women.  The print is lovely and feminine.  The workmanship is excellent.  I am rather particular about quality, this dress did not disappoint.The dress I chose has a dominant purple color.  It also comes in a different shade, the dominant color is a red-orange color; also an attractive color.  Though I did not know it, I saw a picture of one of my cousins wearing the dress she purchased  in the second red-orange color.Also, I happened to buy this dress when it was on sale.",Pretty Garden Dress,2023-09-16,5.0,R21RWUJHJZIG92,Kima513,3.0,"The Good; It's classic, soft, and comfortable. It fit exactly like a 1x would normally fit me (I ordered an XXL). I love the peacock blue color. For me it's a great shade without being too obnoxious.However I had two big issues with it.#1The v neck was a huge problem for me. It showed major major cleavage, to the point were it was insanely inappropriate. I could not wear it without an undershirt because it showed so much. However I do have a very large bust line (42 DD in a full coverage bra) and I could see how that was part of the problem. I don't know if the cleavage would be that intense with a smaller chest. There is a little button you can fasten to make it more modest. On me this button aggressively popped open with the slightest movement and I eventually stopped trying.  This left me with a silver button on one side of the neckline that wasn't horrible, but just looked weird.If you have smaller boobs or don't mind showing cleavage (lots of it)  than this probably wouldn't be an issue for you. For me, it was too much.#2 The dress has a sewn in slip. It's one of those that is shorter than the rest of the dress. It didn't seem to matter at first but when I sat down the slip rode up immediately. Every time I moved, it would ride up more. It was really bad. Like seriously.... REALLY bad. I tried to pull it down, but it was nearly impossible while sitting and was also just embarrassing.There was no way to try to fix it and look classy. It got so bad that I eventually had to grab a scarf (thank God I had one) and cover my legs with it. At one point the entire slip was bunched up around my waist and not covering even a millimeter of my legs. Since the top layer of the dress is see through this was a huge embarrassment. If it wouldn't have been for the scarf I would have had to leave.Maybe it's because I move more than the normal person, or am somehow a freak...? But wearing this dress was a horrible experience for me. I'm not willing to spend $50 on a dress that needs multiple add ons (undershirt, extra slip, blanket)  to make it work so I sent it back.",Loved Until I Wore It,2023-06-28,2.0

It's a solid choice for easy summer clothing, especially at the price. I'm not expecting it to last multiple seasons - but again, at the price that's okay.I also ordered a belt from Amazon to wear with it when I want to look a little more polished. Definitely recommend. Add some jewelry and you're golden.Warning: the dress is short. That's perfect for me. I'm 5-foot-4 with stubby little legs, and most dresses hit me at the extremely unflattering mid-calf length. It's nice to finally get something that sits above the knee right out of the box; this almost never happens! But if you're taller, it might be too short unless you're very thin/attractive/young.Also, if you have an ample backside, as I do...the dress rides up a squidge in the back. It's not a dealbreaker for me since I tend to wear slip shorts under my dresses, but it's something to be aware of. Specific plus size manufacturers are a little better about putting extra material back there. But once again, the cuteness:price ratio of this dress is so good that I can overlook it.I usually wear a size 18 or 18W, and both the XL and 2XL seem to fit me okay. I don't think there's much difference between the sizes. For now I slightly prefer the 2X, but I'll keep the smaller one too.The color is lovely, it's listed as ""red,"" but is almost burgundy. The pockets are a nice touch and don't seem to add bulk for me.

(More later on why I have two of these dresses.) Customer service quickly sent me a replacement for the dark blue dress. (Again, more later.) After the initial gentle ironing, the gray blue dress traveled well in my carry-on. The fabric hung beautifully (I’m nearly 5’8”, 116 lbs.); it’s like satiny slip or nightgown fabric. I dressed it up with a silver wrap and shoes, received many compliments, and still looked good after hours of dancing (two photos provided here were taken late night after the wedding, forgot to pose with the full ensemble). The price is hard to beat.Cons: I gently washed the dark blue dress before wearing and it came out covered with tiny spots (see one photo); I feel certain it was not due to my washer (the instructions did not seem to requite hand washing) but I can’t say for sure whether it was due to faulty dye or something else out of my control. The stitching at the neck, arms and side slits, while not super prominent, looks a bit cheap and is more obvious on the gray blue dress than the dark one (see photo of neck area). The two rounded buttons at the back of the neck are VERY difficult to get in and out of the loops provided. (I succeeded but recommend you replace them with slightly smaller buttons or have someone ready to help.) The small was not at all fitted as in the ad photos. I am happy with the fabric, but be aware it is thin and won’t hide much except for some help provided by the flowing nature of the dress.The full story is that, once the laundry debacle occurred with the dark blue dress I ordered through Vine, I ordered and paid full price for the gray blue one right away, fearing the replacement process would take too long and that I couldn’t trust the dark blue fabric. However, customer service assured me the replacement would come quickly and it did, in time for the wedding! That said, I loved the gray blue color and decided to go with that one, not washing it ahead of time. Everything worked out well. I’ll post more photos if I get some shared from the event.I have not yet washed the replacement dark blue dress, as yet unworn, or the gray blue one that’s been worn the one time.

The neck is really big and doesn’t look like it does on the model. Additionally, the part at the stomach where it goes from floofed to fitted looks good on the model, however, on the actual dress, it is just a piece of elastic and it isn’t very secure.Some people may prefer the elastic band because it creates a bit more wiggle room for size and could be really nice. It is definitely comfy!I ordered a small (Bust: 36”, Waist: 26”, Hips: 36”) and as you can see from the photos, it wasn’t that small. It had no shape to it naturally and it looked very unflattering.I also include photos of how it *could* look if altered. However, it was a $42 dress so I didn’t want to mess with the materials through alterations.The company was very kind and allowed me to return the dress, and I have had no problem with them. They are a good a trustworthy company. The dress itself isn’t even that horrendously off from the ad, but it wasn’t what I was looking for.I am a bridesmaid and, while it might be cute for a night out, it didn’t seem elegant enough in person to be suitable as a bridesmaids dress.",Doesn’t Really Look as Advertised,2023-06-01,3.0

I'll break this review into a few parts.Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing.Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day.Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security — my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here — and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem.Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color.","B on fit, A+ on fabric",2023-08-18,4.0,R33NO5LD7WG99K,Debbie,0.0,"The dress is heavier than I thought it would be.

I’m wearing it to the Jonas Brothers concert and taking it on vacation to Portugal.

The fabric is what was described (95%Rayon/5%Spandex) so that the feel, the buttery-softness, the stretch, and the drape are just what I wanted/expected.  It appears well-sewn, too.  My only disappointment is that, while the website  image of this dress makes the colors appear saturated and vivid, they are not the same in person. The reds do not stand out from the teals and aquas so vividly.  And, although I never noticed it in the website image, there is a lot of pale pink in the background ( not sure even if it stands out in my photo) - sort of giving the print a ""washed-out"" look.  I wanted richer teals and richer reds. As for fit, I am a little over 5'7"" and about 220 lbs., 42C.  I normally wear a size 2X or XXL in tops and dresses, and that's what I ordered.

Will wear it for church and for special occasions.  The bodice has a snap, two more snaps were provided to secure more of the V neckline; which is good because it is too low for me.  The fabric is delicate though not see through; it is lined on the bodice and has a knee length lining, as well.  The long sleeves are not lined; there is a fabric belt made of the same fabric.  The print is lovely.  This dress has a nice fuller skirt, which will fit curvy women.  The print is lovely and feminine.  The workmanship is excellent.  I am rather particular about quality, this dress did not disappoint.The dress I chose has a dominant purple color.  It also comes in a different shade, the dominant color is a red-orange color; also an attractive color.  Though I did not know it, I saw a picture of one of my cousins wearing the dress she purchased  in the second red-orange color.Also, I happened to buy this dress when it was on sale.",Pretty Garden Dress,2023-09-16,5.0,R21RWUJHJZIG92,Kima513,3.0,"The Good; It's classic, soft, and comfortable. It fit exactly like a 1x would normally fit me (I ordered an XXL). I love the peacock blue color. For me it's a great shade without being too obnoxious.However I had two big issues with it.#1The v neck was a huge problem for me. It showed major major cleavage, to the point were it was insanely inappropriate. I could not wear it without an undershirt because it showed so much. However I do have a very large bust line (42 DD in a full coverage bra) and I could see how that was part of the problem. I don't know if the cleavage would be that intense with a smaller chest. There is a little button you can fasten to make it more modest. On me this button aggressively popped open with the slightest movement and I eventually stopped trying.  This left me with a silver button on one side of the neckline that wasn't horrible, but just looked weird.If you have smaller boobs or don't mind showing cleavage (lots of it)  than this probably wouldn't be an issue for you. For me, it was too much.#2 The dress has a sewn in slip. It's one of those that is shorter than the rest of the dress. It didn't seem to matter at first but when I sat down the slip rode up immediately. Every time I moved, it would ride up more. It was really bad. Like seriously.... REALLY bad. I tried to pull it down, but it was nearly impossible while sitting and was also just embarrassing.There was no way to try to fix it and look classy. It got so bad that I eventually had to grab a scarf (thank God I had one) and cover my legs with it. At one point the entire slip was bunched up around my waist and not covering even a millimeter of my legs. Since the top layer of the dress is see through this was a huge embarrassment. If it wouldn't have been for the scarf I would have had to leave.Maybe it's because I move more than the normal person, or am somehow a freak...? But wearing this dress was a horrible experience for me. I'm not willing to spend $50 on a dress that needs multiple add ons (undershirt, extra slip, blanket)  to make it work so I sent it back.",Loved Until I Wore It,2023-06-28,2.0

This is NOT women’s sizing. I think it runs too small to even consider it a juniors size. I’m 5’2 and 110lbs and the XS was very tight but only in the mid section under my bust. The bust area also had way too much fabric which made it look weird. And it’s not that my bust is too small for the dress either. My breasts fill out the lining portion of the dress but then there’s way too much baggy fabric over it.  The zipper is also very difficult to open (even when you aren’t wearing the dress).I really wanted to love this dress because it’s hard for find a short dress that isn’t too short. The length was pretty perfect. I also didn’t think the quality matched the price I paid for the dress. This should of been a $25 dress not a $46 one.,Runs very small,2023-04-07,3.0

I washed the first floral dress on cold in a regular setting ang hung it to dry without reading the reviews. The material looked faded and pilled.After reading the reviews, I washed the second one (navy blue with red flowers) inside-out in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle and hung it to dry. It looked better but still had that fuzzy sheen.I washed my third (black with polka dots) and fourth (tan animal print) ones the same way and they were both fine. The tan one fared best because of its light color.I have not worn or washed the fifth one (red with white flowers). I don't like this one as much. It's tomato red and the big flowers feel cartoonish, almost like Minnie Mouse. But I might try hand-washing from now on.

It's a solid choice for easy summer clothing, especially at the price. I'm not expecting it to last multiple seasons - but again, at the price that's okay.I also ordered a belt from Amazon to wear with it when I want to look a little more polished. Definitely recommend. Add some jewelry and you're golden.Warning: the dress is short. That's perfect for me. I'm 5-foot-4 with stubby little legs, and most dresses hit me at the extremely unflattering mid-calf length. It's nice to finally get something that sits above the knee right out of the box; this almost never happens! But if you're taller, it might be too short unless you're very thin/attractive/young.Also, if you have an ample backside, as I do...the dress rides up a squidge in the back. It's not a dealbreaker for me since I tend to wear slip shorts under my dresses, but it's something to be aware of. Specific plus size manufacturers are a little better about putting extra material back there. But once again, the cuteness:price ratio of this dress is so good that I can overlook it.I usually wear a size 18 or 18W, and both the XL and 2XL seem to fit me okay. I don't think there's much difference between the sizes. For now I slightly prefer the 2X, but I'll keep the smaller one too.The color is lovely, it's listed as ""red,"" but is almost burgundy. The pockets are a nice touch and don't seem to add bulk for me.

I wish I hadn’t worn it already because after spending the day in it, I kinda wanted to return it.

(More later on why I have two of these dresses.) Customer service quickly sent me a replacement for the dark blue dress. (Again, more later.) After the initial gentle ironing, the gray blue dress traveled well in my carry-on. The fabric hung beautifully (I’m nearly 5’8”, 116 lbs.); it’s like satiny slip or nightgown fabric. I dressed it up with a silver wrap and shoes, received many compliments, and still looked good after hours of dancing (two photos provided here were taken late night after the wedding, forgot to pose with the full ensemble). The price is hard to beat.Cons: I gently washed the dark blue dress before wearing and it came out covered with tiny spots (see one photo); I feel certain it was not due to my washer (the instructions did not seem to requite hand washing) but I can’t say for sure whether it was due to faulty dye or something else out of my control. The stitching at the neck, arms and side slits, while not super prominent, looks a bit cheap and is more obvious on the gray blue dress than the dark one (see photo of neck area). The two rounded buttons at the back of the neck are VERY difficult to get in and out of the loops provided. (I succeeded but recommend you replace them with slightly smaller buttons or have someone ready to help.) The small was not at all fitted as in the ad photos. I am happy with the fabric, but be aware it is thin and won’t hide much except for some help provided by the flowing nature of the dress.The full story is that, once the laundry debacle occurred with the dark blue dress I ordered through Vine, I ordered and paid full price for the gray blue one right away, fearing the replacement process would take too long and that I couldn’t trust the dark blue fabric. However, customer service assured me the replacement would come quickly and it did, in time for the wedding! That said, I loved the gray blue color and decided to go with that one, not washing it ahead of time. Everything worked out well. I’ll post more photos if I get some shared from the event.I have not yet washed the replacement dark blue dress, as yet unworn, or the gray blue one that’s been worn the one time. I plan to hand wash them with a delicate wash I’ve ordered.

The neck is really big and doesn’t look like it does on the model. Additionally, the part at the stomach where it goes from floofed to fitted looks good on the model, however, on the actual dress, it is just a piece of elastic and it isn’t very secure.Some people may prefer the elastic band because it creates a bit more wiggle room for size and could be really nice. It is definitely comfy!I ordered a small (Bust: 36”, Waist: 26”, Hips: 36”) and as you can see from the photos, it wasn’t that small. It had no shape to it naturally and it looked very unflattering.I also include photos of how it *could* look if altered. However, it was a $42 dress so I didn’t want to mess with the materials through alterations.The company was very kind and allowed me to return the dress, and I have had no problem with them. They are a good a trustworthy company. The dress itself isn’t even that horrendously off from the ad, but it wasn’t what I was looking for.I am a bridesmaid and, while it might be cute for a night out, it didn’t seem elegant enough in person to be suitable as a bridesmaids dress.",Doesn’t Really Look as Advertised,2023-06-01,3.0

It's comfy, easy to wear/wears well, and the colors are fun! I recently put on some weight and bought this dress to have as a ""throw and go"" outfit that also would hide a multitude of sins. My only minor issue is that the pockets are high up for me. I'm over 5'7"" and find the placement a bit awkward, not just for reaching in and out, but keeping things in the pockets when I bend. My phone falls out every time. I suspect it's designed for shorter/smaller people. I wouldn't call it a ""mini"" dress but it's close as it hits me around mid upper-thigh. The fabric seems to be a kind of jersey, so it has a bit of weight and stretch/give. It's held up well through washing so far -and is mainly wrinkle free, even when it's been in a ball in my gym bag it falls nicely when I put it on. No sign of pilling or fading yet - the colors/pattern seem to be printed on rather than dyed directly into the fabric as the inside is white. This, I suppose, would make each sized dress look a little different depending on how much of the printed material is used. My dress is a large and there is more white than the dress pictured on the model, particularly towards the bottom. I would def buy again.","easy wear, easy care...and looks great",2023-09-18,5.0,R16MFC7NSINQS1,Maggie07,8.0,"EDIT:  see review below for how different colors fared as far as size. I got more and  I list them below.I got this dress in several colors and even though all were size large the actual size varied. When they got it right it was terrific but only one out of three fit.  If I were reviewing only the “sunflower” pattern/color it would be five stars.  That one drapes beautifully, hits my 5’2” frame just at the knee in front, about an inch lower in the back which makes bending over safe!  The 1971 style sunflower pattern ought to be terrible but it looks amazing.  Surprise!  Fits well under the arms and A-lines down over my hips, plus pockets!  BUT I got the same dress in “vintage paintings”  and while the pattern is great, it was a full size larger! It was like a tent on me and fell mid knee…so overall a size up.  The size tag was in a different place and tacked loosely on so perhaps it was a mix up.  But today I got the same dress in “green/white paint”. It’s also baggy and about a half size bigger than the sunflower dress.  Not a flattering fit. In the photo I have that behind the sunflower dress and hopefully you can see about a half inch to an inch or so excess fabric on the green/white one.  That one also was boxy and didn’t hang like the sunflower one.  I had this issue with this company in sleeveless dresses too.  When they get it right it’s amazing but there is such variation in sizing and fit.  One other note on the green/white. Despite it being listed as green it’s more an aqua or warmer toned blue with white and a few spring green details.  Pretty colors on all the dresses but fit varies so widely!  I have one more coming and will edit this review when it arrives.Edit. I got the green Star one and it is lovely.  Fit only slight large, hits mid knee, and flows very well. A keeper.In the same order I got the newsprint one.  It’s huge.  Fits like an XL and falls below the knee.  This one also had the size tag on the back of the neckline.  All the huge ones did.  The ones that fit better had the size tag on the side with the card instructions.  Can I assume they are made in different factories?  Also the newsprint one had one panel of fabric upside down from the other 😕I put in to exchange it for a medium (I’m normally a size 12 and a large) and we will see if that works.  Hopefully it will fit and be right side up, because the  Pattern is adorable. But","Holy cow, this brand needs better quality control (sizing!)",2023-06-16,2.0

The fabric is synthetic, but nice to the touch. It is thick and soft. But then I tried it on. What a weird fit! It was perfect on my butt. The nice, thick fabric hid panty lines and hip bulges. But it went downhill from there. It was tight across my tummy, making it look much bigger than it actually is. Then it was really loose on my waist, across the back, and under the arms.Sexy vamp dress: Because of the weird fit, the only curve the dress accentuated was my pot belly. Yikes! But the big problem is the slit up the left leg. I knew it had a slit -- I saw it in the pictures. But I didn't appreciate that it isn't really a side slit, it is a big huge gap that comes all the way up to about three inches below my panties. While a little side slit would be fine and flirty, this dress is basically open in the front almost to my crotch. Sweater dresses are for cold weather, they don't need to be ventilated.All in all, it looked ridiculous on me.

Nonetheless, I like the empire waist and the fabric breathes well but is not translucent.  The length is nice - the hem sits just above my ankles. I am 5'3. I like that the pockets are higher up than my other dresses for ease of grabbing my phone or keys.  The pockets are large enough to hold my iPhone 13 mini, Edge wallet and keys.  A full size iPhone might be a little to big for the pockets. I thought the flower print was white, but they are a light beige color.  Not bad, but I wanted to mention it. If I purchase another, I'll order a 5X because I prefer loose fitting clothes.",Light and Comfy,2023-08-18,4.0,R3D4RMN2OMS1UX,J L,52.0,"I ordered the orange dress in both XL and 2XL because I was not sure the XL would fit.  I am 5' 7 and somewhere between 175 - 185 lbs (I have not weighed in a while).  The 2XL was much too large and too long, and it looked like it was a return they packed up and sent out again.  I think 2XL would be better suited to someone who is perhaps 225 lbs.The XL is really a bit too long, although a knot at the end of the dress would help if one was wearing flats; otherwise, one would need to wear at least a 2"" heel to make this length work without touching the ground as one moves around, bending, getting in and out of vehicles, etc.  It almost touches the ground whilst I am standing straight up.I think a Large would be a better for someone my height and weight in terms of both length and width, BUT I fear a Large would be too tight beneath the armpits.  The XL just barely feels good beneath the armpits.  The neckline on the XL is good.  There is plenty of room across the bust, the waist, and the hips in the XL.  I am very tempted to order a Large to see if it would not be too tight beneath the armpits, but then there is the CRUCIAL issue of sheerness to consider.I think the pattern/colour is absolutely beautiful, but as other reviewers before me have said, the material is very, very thin, exceedingly thin.  You can hold the dress up in front of you and look through two layers of it and still see everything on the other side quite clearly.Having said all this, if the dress was only $15-$20, I might not have qualms about keeping it, but with tax this dress cost nearly $40!!!  I expect a heck of a lot better material for $40.  At least one other reviewer described the material as being like a bandana.  I could not agree more, and not a high quality bandana at t that.  I am so sad.  I love the colour and pattern, and I would order 2-3 more colours if the material was a lot nicer.  As is, this material could be twice as thick and still be very thin.So, the XL is going to have to go back as well.  I just cannot fathom spending this much money for something this sheer and flimsy feeling--without sufficient undergarments, this dress is obscenely thin!  Not only that, but I would have to buy either a slip and/or pantaloons or tights to wear under this dress, which would push the cost up by another $20+.  That would be a minimum of $60+ dollars to make this dress wearable anywhere but at home alone.  Think about that for a moment.  With appropriate undergarments, the cost to wear this dress would be at least $60.  That is outrageous and NOT a good value AT ALL.If they used a much better fabric than this, I would happily pay $40 (with the tax) for one of these, but not for something this sheer.  I would be shocked even to pay $20 for it.  $15 would be more in line with the quality and with what you would have to do to make the dress wearable.  I am going to go to Walmart or Target or some such store to look for something.  Some items from China are very nice quality, for example, Apple products, but most of the stuff from China is overpriced grot, and these dresses are a prime example of that sad fact.  I can go to higher end department stores and find much higher quality clothing on sale for this price.  The only reason I do not do that is because I no longer enjoy shopping in stores.  If I did still enjoy it, I would go to the mall regularly and watch for good sales on much better quality clothing.I do NOT recommend these dresses unless you can get one for $15.  I doubt one of these would last one whole season if it were used and washed at least 2X per month.Oh, one last thing to note.  This dress will require hand washing, line drying, and a cool iron because it wrinkles very badly.  If you wash this in the washing machine with mild soap on the gentlest cycle, I think it would come apart in as little as 2-3 washings.  It may come apart in as little as 2-3 washings even if you wash by hand.  This is a HIGH MAINTENANCE dress that even with great care is not likely to last even one season.",EXTREMELY THIN MATERIAL --- Needs Slip/Pantaloons/Tights to be Wearable --- High Maintenance,2021-10-14,2.0

The other issue (for me) is that this dress has no liner and is rather thin, so if the light hits you the right way it's going to be see-through.All that being said, if you don't mind putting in that extra effort for this dress then it's for you.

I have narrow hips and this helps give a subtle shape but it won’t overdo it if you are blessed with womanly hips.DETAILINGThe back of the dress has some details that I love.  There is a horizontal seam connecting the upper body to the lower body and a small pleat is right in the middle.  It’s a beautiful detail that add interest so it’s not a plain cutout pattern.COLORI added a picture to show the color.  I bought the khaki color but it’s not khaki - it’s more of a earthy color (something in between mushroom and brown).MATERIALThe material thickness is in between light to medium.  It’s very soft and I could easily sleep in it if I wanted to.LENGTHI ordered a large and it almost touches the floor.  I am almost 5’1”.

And it can't be worn as an off the shoulder because number 1 she's 10, and number 2 the back, top portion of the dress rolls down when the sleeves are worn off the shoulder, One more think is the Zipper feels as tho it is not going to last long, and the dress is not too tight causing this issue either it has issues on or off the body.","So It's not as I exspected, but could be okay",2023-02-07,3.0

This dress is, without a doubt, overpriced.  I think the thing I dislike the most is that the picture is deceptive regarding the waistline. It could be freakin’ awesome and flattering if the waist fell where it does in the picture but it’s much higher than that so not as flattering. As mentioned in other reviews, the collar flops around. There is a very cute work around. You can easily tuck the sides in and, even better iron the sides of the collar all the way down into a v neck and it stays and it’s adorable.Some people said it wrinkles too easily but it really doesn’t. It just needs a quick steam after you wash it on cold and let it hang to dry. Now for the good stuff, the material is paper thin and very breathable but it’s good material and you feel adequately covered. The kind of material you don’t get all sweaty in on a hot day. It is perfect for taking kids to the splash pad on a hot day or really anything. You could wear it to the pool but you could also wear it to church. It’s that versatile. All in all, it’s a cute dress. I’m happy I bought it. I have it in burnt orange which is very vibrant and my husband likes it a lot. I also got it in the navy blue. It’s pretty. Just know it is the darkest, blackest blue I’ve ever seen. We had to hold it under the light to make sure it really is blue. But i like it. The length is perfect. I don’t like too long but I want my knees well covered.  I am 5’4”/175#. Hope this helps.  And, again, it doesn’t wrinkle easily, it just needs a quick once over after you wash it on cold and let it hang dry because there are fine faint wrinkles all over if you don’t. But just wearing it or having in your suitcase does not cause wrinkles.",Mixed Review,2023-07-26,3.0

I am 5'6"", recently put on a lot of weight (now 178 lbs) and most of it in my midsection, 36DD bra size, no significant hips or booty.  So, a moderately busty apple figure. Usually wear a size 10-12 or L/XL (depending on the brand) at this weight. I got the XL Plus in black.PROS: Wow, the cut is super flattering.  I actually looked more hourglass in this dress and less like a sausage with boobs.  The cut of the dress is great. I wasn't sure how I would like the sleeves, but I love them.CONS: The neckline is way too open, so I had to wear a sheer camisole underneath. Luckily I have one that is ultra thin.  Also, the fabric to me is just two levels above Halloween costume material, as is the stitching.  If the light hits it just right you can see a bit of the silhouette of your legs. At first glance it looks like nice fabric, but when you look closer it's...hmmm....which is too bad because I would pay a bit more for better fabric and stitching because the style is so great. In any case, I wore it to an evening event and it looked great!","Looks amazing, with big caveats",2022-10-28,4.0,REPNVP3ZQSZ0N,Myrlande,1.0,Would have been ideal but missing belt,Missing belt,2023-08-02,3.0

(This review applies to the “green/khaki” option only)Fit: 5/5I am 5’5, 195 lbs, 38C/D, and usually wear a size L or XL in tops/14 or 16 in bottoms. My measurements are 41.5/37/47. I ordered this dress in a L and it fits perfectly.Fabric quality: 5/5Lightweight, stretchy yet heavy enough to flow nicely, comfortable fabric that would be perfect in summer. Not sheer at all, even in the stretched areas.Similarity to picture/quality control: 0/5I ordered the one called “green/khaki” and in the picture it looks like a muted, green-leaning type of teal color. In reality it is a much more vivid, blueish color. But the dealbreaker is the cheap way the print is laid out. In the product picture, the bands of khaki are placed horizontally in a flattering way at the shoulders, waistband, and a short distance above the hem. In reality, the bands of khaki on the dress I got were not quite horizontal, didn’t match up at the side seams, and were at different heights than in the product picture. Their placement emphasizes the width of my hips in an unflattering way, when it would be much better if it was at the actual waistband, as advertised. If the company sent me a dress that matched the picture, I’d keep it, but it’s annoying to have to take a gamble in the first place on what you order vs. what you receive.Miscellaneous:The dress doesn’t show any cleavage on me, but it theoretically could if I pulled the chest pieces to either side a bit (not sure if they’d stay there though.) It’s stretchy enough to be a great option for breastfeeding moms. It also has pockets.",Almost a keeper but not quite. Poor fabric layout,2023-04-17,3.0

If so, this movie deserves every acting category.I know the Oscars are dumb, but it is interesting that Courtenay and Finney are playing their roles as if they have an emotional megaphone, and were both nominated, but Robert Duvall won it for Tender Mercies with his understated but haunted performance. A study in contrasts to be sure.

It is the same rather thin fabric. But I have determined it is good in hot weather. Between the larger size and very dark colour, the wine red dress is totally opaque. (I felt the lighter coloured leopard print had a potentiel to show my bra, depending on the colour, especially if it was any tighter over the chest. It didn't, though.)Regarding the colour, please note that it is more burgundy than red, cool and deep, almost shading into aubergine. It's all right on me because I am a former brunette (my hair is now naturally grey), but the colour might be a bit dark and heavy on a blonde or redhead. Of course, it depends on your taste, but I thought the colour looked much lighter and redder in the pictures than it does in real life.I really think L was my size, but I do appreciate the additional looseness in the hips and waist areas afforded by the XL, as well as the additional length. I am 5'10"", and the L is an above-the-ankle dress, when the XL is ankle length, in flats, which is how I will mostly wear them. The top part is quite loose. The arm holes are deep and loose and the bust is loose as well. I have broad shoulders, a very large rib cage and a medium-sized bosom (C cup), plus biggish arms (think middle-aged swimmer), so it is unusual for me to find clothes are too big on top. I think you should bear that in mind for sizing. If, like me, you want the dress to be non-clingy around the waist and stomach, it may be challenging to get a good fit unless you have a very full chest. Indeed, I think I will try this with a padded bra next time.The price point is sort of middle-of-the-road and so are the dresses. I think they will hold up well; others I had in this brand did and I have washed and worn the leopard dress maybe four times now and the wine one once with no noticeable changes whatsoever. They are not thrilling dresses, but they are serviceable and handy, especially in a hot climate (and I live in Africa). They could have been better, and I am surprised by the fit, but overall, I am happy with my purchases and will wear them often. I like that the skirt is a bit wider on the bottom and doesn't have a slit. It is easy to walk in (I have a long stride and can't stand a skirt that hobbles my gait), and the fact it doesn't have a slit means I don't have to worry about a slip showing underneath.Leopard Print LThis dress is one I am going to keep, but I think I will mostly wear it under a jean jacket. This dress has several minor issues. The material is thinner and more polyester-like than expected. It is not see-through, however, despite the light-coloured base. The beige shade is deeper and warmer than expected, which may be nice for some, but is not very good for me (I have grey hair and was expecting more of an ecru, it's almost a tan). Above all, it is clingy without being tight. The material just sticks to any lumps or bumps. I could literally see the outline of the elastic on my panties. Not an indent, because they're not tight, but the actual top and bottom of the elastic. And it pointed out the little pooch and the little pouch in my midsection. Thankfully the skirt is a little looser, it's an A-line style, so I didn't see anything on my lower hips. I admit I haven't tried it with a slip and might play around with different underwear options. If I were a Spanx wearer, it would be lovely, but I don't do that... if I can find a cool shift to put underneath, it might smooth things out. We'll see...Update a week later: This dress is growing on me. The colour is all right. The thin fabric makes it cooler in this stifling heat. I haven't found a shift, but I've worn a half slip. You can see the little line around my waist, but it's not the end of the world, as you can see, I'm obviously not going to be on any catwalks any time soon. Great dress for wearing around the house, and will probably look cute under my jean jacket in cooler weather.Further update: tried it with loose tap pants and it was all the dress needed for modesty and very cool and comfortable.",The fabric is a tad bit thin... size up if you don't mind it being loose in chest and armpits,2022-06-08,4.0,R3OOQFZN895K79,Evette Shaffer,0.0,Dress fits true to size but smells strongly of incense.

Same issue when trying to raise my arms and the fit with my arms down, standing relaxed, was not as good as the medium. I really loved the print and wanted this dress to work but the fit is terrible on the top half of the dress (in my opinion).

I'll break this review into a few parts.Firstly, can't complain about something that looks decent and costs under $50. If I had more freedom of choice I might have gotten one of the sale prints but the event determined the need for subdued. Received it in two days, giving me enough time to wash it before wearing.Secondly, the fabric is a slinky kind of knit, not too thin but not too heavy. It was tolerable outdoors in triple-digit-heat-index weather. It had great movement too; I didn't feel at all restricted climbing into and out of a tall vehicle, and while walking/standing all day. For me it required a sweater indoors, but the funeral parlor was admittedly kept cold. After washing and drying, I hung it up and didn't need to iron; it also showed no wrinkles at the end of wearing all day.Thirdly, the fit. I'm short with an Unfortunately Sized bust; I have to fit everything to that part of the anatomy and hope I can make enough alterations elsewhere to not look horrible. This is a true wrap dress and that aspect helped me in getting a decent fit at waist and hips. The armholes for me gapped a little; the shoulders are a little too tall (admittedly my shoulder-to-bust distance is shorter than most manufacturers cut and I always have this problem). I wore a black bra underneath to minimize any undergarment peek but I'll need to make a formal alteration at some point. Sleeves would have solved this problem but I didn't want to go with longer sleeves in the warm weather. I also needed to add two safety pins: one next to the button for security — my button held fine but I didn't want to tempt fate based on some experiences in other reviews here — and one where the neckline overlapped as leaning forward caused the front to gap indecently open. A person with a smaller bust might not have as much of a gap problem but the more generously endowed may consider the mighty safety pin. A small snap added to the overlap would also solve the gap problem.Overall I have no complaints as this did everything I needed it to do, and comfortably enough to consider ordering the dress in another color.","B on fit, A+ on fabric",2023-08-18,4.0,R33NO5LD7WG99K,Debbie,0.0,"The dress is heavier than I thought it would be.

I’m wearing it to the Jonas Brothers concert and taking it on vacation to Portugal.

This one kept coming up as a suggestion and I loved the green color. I thought it would be great for St. Patrick’s Day! The picture made the color look so vivid but the dress I received was a much duller shade of green. I honestly didn’t even try it on because I couldn’t get past the color. Just from holding it up I could tell that the length would work. It also seemed that the bodice was longer than the other dress I had ordered and I have a short torso so I don’t think it would have fit well.

It is nearly equal in quality to several other dresses in the exact style and fabric content that I've purchased from Amazon and from another ""major"" retailer.  The fabric is what was described (95%Rayon/5%Spandex) so that the feel, the buttery-softness, the stretch, and the drape are just what I wanted/expected.  It appears well-sewn, too.  My only disappointment is that, while the website  image of this dress makes the colors appear saturated and vivid, they are not the same in person. The reds do not stand out from the teals and aquas so vividly.  And, although I never noticed it in the website image, there is a lot of pale pink in the background ( not sure even if it stands out in my photo) - sort of giving the print a ""washed-out"" look.  I wanted richer teals and richer reds. As for fit, I am a little over 5'7"" and about 220 lbs., 42C.  I normally wear a size 2X or XXL in tops and dresses, and that's what I ordered.

Will wear it for church and for special occasions.  The bodice has a snap, two more snaps were provided to secure more of the V neckline; which is good because it is too low for me.

It also comes in a different shade, the dominant color is a red-orange color; also an attractive color.

It fit exactly like a 1x would normally fit me (I ordered an XXL). I love the peacock blue color. For me it's a great shade without being too obnoxious.However I had two big issues with it.#1The v neck was a huge problem for me. It showed major major cleavage, to the point were it was insanely inappropriate. I could not wear it without an undershirt because it showed so much. However I do have a very large bust line (42 DD in a full coverage bra) and I could see how that was part of the problem. I don't know if the cleavage would be that intense with a smaller chest. There is a little button you can fasten to make it more modest. On me this button aggressively popped open with the slightest movement and I eventually stopped trying.  This left me with a silver button on one side of the neckline that wasn't horrible, but just looked weird.If you have smaller boobs or don't mind showing cleavage (lots of it)  than this probably wouldn't be an issue for you. For me, it was too much.#2 The dress has a sewn in slip. It's one of those that is shorter than the rest of the dress. It didn't seem to matter at first but when I sat down the slip rode up immediately. Every time I moved, it would ride up more. It was really bad. Like seriously.... REALLY bad. I tried to pull it down, but it was nearly impossible while sitting and was also just embarrassing.There was no way to try to fix it and look classy. It got so bad that I eventually had to grab a scarf (thank God I had one) and cover my legs with it. At one point the entire slip was bunched up around my waist and not covering even a millimeter of my legs. Since the top layer of the dress is see through this was a huge embarrassment. If it wouldn't have been for the scarf I would have had to leave.Maybe it's because I move more than the normal person, or am somehow a freak...? But wearing this dress was a horrible experience for me. I'm not willing to spend $50 on a dress that needs multiple add ons (undershirt, extra slip, blanket)  to make it work so I sent it back.",Loved Until I Wore It,2023-06-28,2.0

I ordered this dress last minute and IT DIDNOT DISAPPOINT!!  I will say, the blue online looks  more like navy which is what I wanted originally.  I almost returned it because I wasn’t looking for a bright jewel tone. And then I tried it on. It is an absolutely stunning dress. Because it’s 100% polyester it moves well and was great for dancing. I did have to iron it before wear and the wrinkles came out easily. It looks very shapeless when you first put it on but once you tie the enclosed (double lined, good quality) sash it sucks you in in the perfect place and gives you a great figure. (I don’t have the tiniest waist). Also, the belt loops on the side are thick and good quality (same color as the dress. Not thin and clear like other dresses).

This is NOT women’s sizing. I think it runs too small to even consider it a juniors size. I’m 5’2 and 110lbs and the XS was very tight but only in the mid section under my bust. The bust area also had way too much fabric which made it look weird. And it’s not that my bust is too small for the dress either. My breasts fill out the lining portion of the dress but then there’s way too much baggy fabric over it.  The zipper is also very difficult to open (even when you aren’t wearing the dress).I really wanted to love this dress because it’s hard for find a short dress that isn’t too short. The length was pretty perfect. I also didn’t think the quality matched the price I paid for the dress. This should of been a $25 dress not a $46 one.,Runs very small,2023-04-07,3.0

The tan one fared best because of its light color.I have not worn or washed the fifth one (red with white flowers). I don't like this one as much. It's tomato red and the big flowers feel cartoonish, almost like Minnie Mouse. But I might try hand-washing from now on.

It's a solid choice for easy summer clothing, especially at the price. I'm not expecting it to last multiple seasons - but again, at the price that's okay.I also ordered a belt from Amazon to wear with it when I want to look a little more polished. Definitely recommend. Add some jewelry and you're golden.Warning: the dress is short. That's perfect for me. I'm 5-foot-4 with stubby little legs, and most dresses hit me at the extremely unflattering mid-calf length. It's nice to finally get something that sits above the knee right out of the box; this almost never happens! But if you're taller, it might be too short unless you're very thin/attractive/young.Also, if you have an ample backside, as I do...the dress rides up a squidge in the back. It's not a dealbreaker for me since I tend to wear slip shorts under my dresses, but it's something to be aware of. Specific plus size manufacturers are a little better about putting extra material back there. But once again, the cuteness:price ratio of this dress is so good that I can overlook it.I usually wear a size 18 or 18W, and both the XL and 2XL seem to fit me okay. I don't think there's much difference between the sizes. For now I slightly prefer the 2X, but I'll keep the smaller one too.The color is lovely, it's listed as ""red,"" but is almost burgundy. The pockets are a nice touch and don't seem to add bulk for me. Though realistically, at this price point, there is probably a wide variation in how they look when they come out of the factory.All in all - worth it!

I wish I hadn’t worn it already because after spending the day in it, I kinda wanted to return it.

(More later on why I have two of these dresses.) Customer service quickly sent me a replacement for the dark blue dress. (Again, more later.) After the initial gentle ironing, the gray blue dress traveled well in my carry-on. The fabric hung beautifully (I’m nearly 5’8”, 116 lbs.); it’s like satiny slip or nightgown fabric. I dressed it up with a silver wrap and shoes, received many compliments, and still looked good after hours of dancing (two photos provided here were taken late night after the wedding, forgot to pose with the full ensemble). The price is hard to beat.Cons: I gently washed the dark blue dress before wearing and it came out covered with tiny spots (see one photo); I feel certain it was not due to my washer (the instructions did not seem to requite hand washing) but I can’t say for sure whether it was due to faulty dye or something else out of my control. The stitching at the neck, arms and side slits, while not super prominent, looks a bit cheap and is more obvious on the gray blue dress than the dark one (see photo of neck area). The two rounded buttons at the back of the neck are VERY difficult to get in and out of the loops provided. (I succeeded but recommend you replace them with slightly smaller buttons or have someone ready to help.) The small was not at all fitted as in the ad photos. I am happy with the fabric, but be aware it is thin and won’t hide much except for some help provided by the flowing nature of the dress.The full story is that, once the laundry debacle occurred with the dark blue dress I ordered through Vine, I ordered and paid full price for the gray blue one right away, fearing the replacement process would take too long and that I couldn’t trust the dark blue fabric. However, customer service assured me the replacement would come quickly and it did, in time for the wedding! That said, I loved the gray blue color and decided to go with that one, not washing it ahead of time. Everything worked out well. I’ll post more photos if I get some shared from the event.I have not yet washed the replacement dark blue dress, as yet unworn, or the gray blue one that’s been worn the one time. I plan to hand wash them with a delicate wash I’ve ordered. I will update with the results!",Worked for me but things to know,2023-02-05,4.0,R1OT2CHJKNVV4B,Mac M.,23.0,"The material doesn’t look the same, and the color is a bit off. The neck is really big and doesn’t look like it does on the model. Additionally, the part at the stomach where it goes from floofed to fitted looks good on the model, however, on the actual dress, it is just a piece of elastic and it isn’t very secure.Some people may prefer the elastic band because it creates a bit more wiggle room for size and could be really nice. It is definitely comfy!I ordered a small (Bust: 36”, Waist: 26”, Hips: 36”) and as you can see from the photos, it wasn’t that small. It had no shape to it naturally and it looked very unflattering.I also include photos of how it *could* look if altered. However, it was a $42 dress so I didn’t want to mess with the materials through alterations.The company was very kind and allowed me to return the dress, and I have had no problem with them. They are a good a trustworthy company. The dress itself isn’t even that horrendously off from the ad, but it wasn’t what I was looking for.I am a bridesmaid and, while it might be cute for a night out, it didn’t seem elegant enough in person to be suitable as a bridesmaids dress.",Doesn’t Really Look as Advertised,2023-06-01,3.0

It's comfy, easy to wear/wears well, and the colors are fun! I recently put on some weight and bought this dress to have as a ""throw and go"" outfit that also would hide a multitude of sins. My only minor issue is that the pockets are high up for me. I'm over 5'7"" and find the placement a bit awkward, not just for reaching in and out, but keeping things in the pockets when I bend. My phone falls out every time. I suspect it's designed for shorter/smaller people. I wouldn't call it a ""mini"" dress but it's close as it hits me around mid upper-thigh. The fabric seems to be a kind of jersey, so it has a bit of weight and stretch/give. It's held up well through washing so far -and is mainly wrinkle free, even when it's been in a ball in my gym bag it falls nicely when I put it on. No sign of pilling or fading yet - the colors/pattern seem to be printed on rather than dyed directly into the fabric as the inside is white. This, I suppose, would make each sized dress look a little different depending on how much of the printed material is used. My dress is a large and there is more white than the dress pictured on the model, particularly towards the bottom. I would def buy again.","easy wear, easy care...and looks great",2023-09-18,5.0,R16MFC7NSINQS1,Maggie07,8.0,"EDIT:  see review below for how different colors fared as far as size. I got more and  I list them below.I got this dress in several colors and even though all were size large the actual size varied. When they got it right it was terrific but only one out of three fit.  If I were reviewing only the “sunflower” pattern/color it would be five stars.  That one drapes beautifully, hits my 5’2” frame just at the knee in front, about an inch lower in the back which makes bending over safe!  The 1971 style sunflower pattern ought to be terrible but it looks amazing.  Surprise!  Fits well under the arms and A-lines down over my hips, plus pockets!  BUT I got the same dress in “vintage paintings”  and while the pattern is great, it was a full size larger! It was like a tent on me and fell mid knee…so overall a size up.  The size tag was in a different place and tacked loosely on so perhaps it was a mix up.  But today I got the same dress in “green/white paint”. It’s also baggy and about a half size bigger than the sunflower dress.  Not a flattering fit. In the photo I have that behind the sunflower dress and hopefully you can see about a half inch to an inch or so excess fabric on the green/white one.  That one also was boxy and didn’t hang like the sunflower one.  I had this issue with this company in sleeveless dresses too.  When they get it right it’s amazing but there is such variation in sizing and fit.  One other note on the green/white. Despite it being listed as green it’s more an aqua or warmer toned blue with white and a few spring green details.  Pretty colors on all the dresses but fit varies so widely!  I have one more coming and will edit this review when it arrives.Edit. I got the green Star one and it is lovely.  Fit only slight large, hits mid knee, and flows very well. A keeper.In the same order I got the newsprint one.  It’s huge.  Fits like an XL and falls below the knee.  This one also had the size tag on the back of the neckline.  All the huge ones did.  The ones that fit better had the size tag on the side with the card instructions.  Can I assume they are made in different factories?  Also the newsprint one had one panel of fabric upside down from the other 😕I put in to exchange it for a medium (I’m normally a size 12 and a large) and we will see if that works.  Hopefully it will fit and be right side up, because the  Pattern is adorable. But","Holy cow, this brand needs better quality control (sizing!)",2023-06-16,2.0

It doesn't know what it is.Snuggly sweater dress: It definitely had good possibilities when I unwrapped it. The color (I got the rusty burgundy one) is pretty and perfect for fall. The fabric is synthetic, but nice to the touch. It is thick and soft. But then I tried it on. What a weird fit! It was perfect on my butt. The nice, thick fabric hid panty lines and hip bulges. But it went downhill from there. It was tight across my tummy, making it look much bigger than it actually is. Then it was really loose on my waist, across the back, and under the arms.Sexy vamp dress: Because of the weird fit, the only curve the dress accentuated was my pot belly. Yikes! But the big problem is the slit up the left leg. I knew it had a slit -- I saw it in the pictures. But I didn't appreciate that it isn't really a side slit, it is a big huge gap that comes all the way up to about three inches below my panties. While a little side slit would be fine and flirty, this dress is basically open in the front almost to my crotch. Sweater dresses are for cold weather, they don't need to be ventilated.All in all, it looked ridiculous on me. It might work on someone with a different figure, like a much bigger chest, who doesn't mind the gap in the front. But I looked like a street walker in a sleeping bag.",split personality dress,2023-09-07,3.0

I am a 48 DDD and the stop is snug. I worry when I wash it, it may shrink or get tighter.  I will try air drying the dress to reduce shrinkage. Nonetheless, I like the empire waist and the fabric breathes well but is not translucent.  The length is nice - the hem sits just above my ankles. I am 5'3. I like that the pockets are higher up than my other dresses for ease of grabbing my phone or keys.  The pockets are large enough to hold my iPhone 13 mini, Edge wallet and keys.  A full size iPhone might be a little to big for the pockets. I thought the flower print was white, but they are a light beige color.  Not bad, but I wanted to mention it. If I purchase another, I'll order a 5X because I prefer loose fitting clothes.",Light and Comfy,2023-08-18,4.0,R3D4RMN2OMS1UX,J L,52.0,"I ordered the orange dress in both XL and 2XL because I was not sure the XL would fit.  I am 5' 7 and somewhere between 175 - 185 lbs (I have not weighed in a while).  The 2XL was much too large and too long, and it looked like it was a return they packed up and sent out again.  I think 2XL would be better suited to someone who is perhaps 225 lbs.The XL is really a bit too long, although a knot at the end of the dress would help if one was wearing flats; otherwise, one would need to wear at least a 2"" heel to make this length work without touching the ground as one moves around, bending, getting in and out of vehicles, etc.  It almost touches the ground whilst I am standing straight up.I think a Large would be a better for someone my height and weight in terms of both length and width, BUT I fear a Large would be too tight beneath the armpits.  The XL just barely feels good beneath the armpits.  The neckline on the XL is good.  There is plenty of room across the bust, the waist, and the hips in the XL.  I am very tempted to order a Large to see if it would not be too tight beneath the armpits, but then there is the CRUCIAL issue of sheerness to consider.I think the pattern/colour is absolutely beautiful, but as other reviewers before me have said, the material is very, very thin, exceedingly thin.  You can hold the dress up in front of you and look through two layers of it and still see everything on the other side quite clearly.Having said all this, if the dress was only $15-$20, I might not have qualms about keeping it, but with tax this dress cost nearly $40!!!  I expect a heck of a lot better material for $40.  At least one other reviewer described the material as being like a bandana.  I could not agree more, and not a high quality bandana at t that.  I am so sad.  I love the colour and pattern, and I would order 2-3 more colours if the material was a lot nicer.  As is, this material could be twice as thick and still be very thin.So, the XL is going to have to go back as well.  I just cannot fathom spending this much money for something this sheer and flimsy feeling--without sufficient undergarments, this dress is obscenely thin!  Not only that, but I would have to buy either a slip and/or pantaloons or tights to wear under this dress, which would push the cost up by another $20+.  That would be a minimum of $60+ dollars to make this dress wearable anywhere but at home alone.  Think about that for a moment.  With appropriate undergarments, the cost to wear this dress would be at least $60.  That is outrageous and NOT a good value AT ALL.If they used a much better fabric than this, I would happily pay $40 (with the tax) for one of these, but not for something this sheer.  I would be shocked even to pay $20 for it.  $15 would be more in line with the quality and with what you would have to do to make the dress wearable.  I am going to go to Walmart or Target or some such store to look for something.  Some items from China are very nice quality, for example, Apple products, but most of the stuff from China is overpriced grot, and these dresses are a prime example of that sad fact.  I can go to higher end department stores and find much higher quality clothing on sale for this price.  The only reason I do not do that is because I no longer enjoy shopping in stores.  If I did still enjoy it, I would go to the mall regularly and watch for good sales on much better quality clothing.I do NOT recommend these dresses unless you can get one for $15.  I doubt one of these would last one whole season if it were used and washed at least 2X per month.Oh, one last thing to note.  This dress will require hand washing, line drying, and a cool iron because it wrinkles very badly.  If you wash this in the washing machine with mild soap on the gentlest cycle, I think it would come apart in as little as 2-3 washings.  It may come apart in as little as 2-3 washings even if you wash by hand.  This is a HIGH MAINTENANCE dress that even with great care is not likely to last even one season.",EXTREMELY THIN MATERIAL --- Needs Slip/Pantaloons/Tights to be Wearable --- High Maintenance,2021-10-14,2.0

This dress is, without a doubt, overpriced.  I think the thing I dislike the most is that the picture is deceptive regarding the waistline. It could be freakin’ awesome and flattering if the waist fell where it does in the picture but it’s much higher than that so not as flattering. As mentioned in other reviews, the collar flops around. There is a very cute work around. You can easily tuck the sides in and, even better iron the sides of the collar all the way down into a v neck and it stays and it’s adorable.Some people said it wrinkles too easily but it really doesn’t. It just needs a quick steam after you wash it on cold and let it hang to dry. Now for the good stuff, the material is paper thin and very breathable but it’s good material and you feel adequately covered. The kind of material you don’t get all sweaty in on a hot day. It is perfect for taking kids to the splash pad on a hot day or really anything. You could wear it to the pool but you could also wear it to church. It’s that versatile. All in all, it’s a cute dress. I’m happy I bought it. I have it in burnt orange which is very vibrant and my husband likes it a lot. I also got it in the navy blue. It’s pretty. Just know it is the darkest, blackest blue I’ve ever seen. We had to hold it under the light to make sure it really is blue. But i like it. The length is perfect. I don’t like too long but I want my knees well covered.  I am 5’4”/175#. Hope this helps.  And, again, it doesn’t wrinkle easily, it just needs a quick once over after you wash it on cold and let it hang dry because there are fine faint wrinkles all over if you don’t.

I am 5'6"", recently put on a lot of weight (now 178 lbs) and most of it in my midsection, 36DD bra size, no significant hips or booty.  So, a moderately busty apple figure. Usually wear a size 10-12 or L/XL (depending on the brand) at this weight. I got the XL Plus in black.PROS: Wow, the cut is super flattering.  I actually looked more hourglass in this dress and less like a sausage with boobs.  The cut of the dress is great. I wasn't sure how I would like the sleeves, but I love them.CONS: The neckline is way too open, so I had to wear a sheer camisole underneath. Luckily I have one that is ultra thin.  Also, the fabric to me is just two levels above Halloween costume material, as is the stitching.  If the light hits it just right you can see a bit of the silhouette of your legs. At first glance it looks like nice fabric, but when you look closer it's...hmmm....which is too bad because I would pay a bit more for better fabric and stitching because the style is so great.

(This review applies to the “green/khaki” option only)Fit: 5/5I am 5’5, 195 lbs, 38C/D, and usually wear a size L or XL in tops/14 or 16 in bottoms. My measurements are 41.5/37/47. I ordered this dress in a L and it fits perfectly.Fabric quality: 5/5Lightweight, stretchy yet heavy enough to flow nicely, comfortable fabric that would be perfect in summer. Not sheer at all, even in the stretched areas.Similarity to picture/quality control: 0/5I ordered the one called “green/khaki” and in the picture it looks like a muted, green-leaning type of teal color. In reality it is a much more vivid, blueish color. But the dealbreaker is the cheap way the print is laid out. In the product picture, the bands of khaki are placed horizontally in a flattering way at the shoulders, waistband, and a short distance above the hem. In reality, the bands of khaki on the dress I got were not quite horizontal, didn’t match up at the side seams, and were at different heights than in the product picture. Their placement emphasizes the width of my hips in an unflattering way, when it would be much better if it was at the actual waistband, as advertised. If the company sent me a dress that matched the picture, I’d keep it, but it’s annoying to have to take a gamble in the first place on what you order vs. what you receive.Miscellaneous:The dress doesn’t show any cleavage on me, but it theoretically could if I pulled the chest pieces to either side a bit (not sure if they’d stay there though.) It’s stretchy enough to be a great option for breastfeeding moms. It also has pockets.",Almost a keeper but not quite. Poor fabric layout,2023-04-17,3.0

If so, this movie deserves every acting category.I know the Oscars are dumb, but it is interesting that Courtenay and Finney are playing their roles as if they have an emotional megaphone, and were both nominated, but Robert Duvall won it for Tender Mercies with his understated but haunted performance. A study in contrasts to be sure.

It is the same rather thin fabric. But I have determined it is good in hot weather. Between the larger size and very dark colour, the wine red dress is totally opaque. (I felt the lighter coloured leopard print had a potentiel to show my bra, depending on the colour, especially if it was any tighter over the chest. It didn't, though.)Regarding the colour, please note that it is more burgundy than red, cool and deep, almost shading into aubergine. It's all right on me because I am a former brunette (my hair is now naturally grey), but the colour might be a bit dark and heavy on a blonde or redhead. Of course, it depends on your taste, but I thought the colour looked much lighter and redder in the pictures than it does in real life.I really think L was my size, but I do appreciate the additional looseness in the hips and waist areas afforded by the XL, as well as the additional length. I am 5'10"", and the L is an above-the-ankle dress, when the XL is ankle length, in flats, which is how I will mostly wear them. The top part is quite loose. The arm holes are deep and loose and the bust is loose as well. I have broad shoulders, a very large rib cage and a medium-sized bosom (C cup), plus biggish arms (think middle-aged swimmer), so it is unusual for me to find clothes are too big on top. I think you should bear that in mind for sizing. If, like me, you want the dress to be non-clingy around the waist and stomach, it may be challenging to get a good fit unless you have a very full chest. Indeed, I think I will try this with a padded bra next time.The price point is sort of middle-of-the-road and so are the dresses. I think they will hold up well; others I had in this brand did and I have washed and worn the leopard dress maybe four times now and the wine one once with no noticeable changes whatsoever. They are not thrilling dresses, but they are serviceable and handy, especially in a hot climate (and I live in Africa). They could have been better, and I am surprised by the fit, but overall, I am happy with my purchases and will wear them often. I like that the skirt is a bit wider on the bottom and doesn't have a slit. It is easy to walk in (I have a long stride and can't stand a skirt that hobbles my gait), and the fact it doesn't have a slit means I don't have to worry about a slip showing underneath.Leopard Print LThis dress is one I am going to keep, but I think I will mostly wear it under a jean jacket. This dress has several minor issues. The material is thinner and more polyester-like than expected. It is not see-through, however, despite the light-coloured base. The beige shade is deeper and warmer than expected, which may be nice for some, but is not very good for me (I have grey hair and was expecting more of an ecru, it's almost a tan). Above all, it is clingy without being tight. The material just sticks to any lumps or bumps. I could literally see the outline of the elastic on my panties. Not an indent, because they're not tight, but the actual top and bottom of the elastic. And it pointed out the little pooch and the little pouch in my midsection. Thankfully the skirt is a little looser, it's an A-line style, so I didn't see anything on my lower hips. I admit I haven't tried it with a slip and might play around with different underwear options. If I were a Spanx wearer, it would be lovely, but I don't do that... if I can find a cool shift to put underneath, it might smooth things out. We'll see...Update a week later: This dress is growing on me. The colour is all right. The thin fabric makes it cooler in this stifling heat. I haven't found a shift, but I've worn a half slip. You can see the little line around my waist, but it's not the end of the world, as you can see, I'm obviously not going to be on any catwalks any time soon. Great dress for wearing around the house, and will probably look cute under my jean jacket in cooler weather.Further update: tried it with loose tap pants and it was all the dress needed for modesty and very cool and comfortable.",The fabric is a tad bit thin... size up if you don't mind it being loose in chest and armpits,2022-06-08,4.0,R3OOQFZN895K79,Evette Shaffer,0.0,Dress fits true to size but smells strongly of incense.

Same issue when trying to raise my arms and the fit with my arms down, standing relaxed, was not as good as the medium. I really loved the print and wanted this dress to work but the fit is terrible on the top half of the dress (in my opinion).

My skin breaks down easily - and if I start sweating I easily develop skin infections.  My doctor wants me to wear very loose clothing with no underwear when it gets hot or if I'm doing work that causes me to sweat.  So this looked like the perfect garment - 100% USA grown cotton.  I was initially unhappy as hell when I opened the package and put the dress on.  But I decided to just try wearing it a bit.  I'm 5'3"" and about 118 pounds and I ordered a medium.  It was super baggy around the neck and fit like a girdle around my waist and hips.  After I had it on a couple of hours, the dress started fitting me much better.  It was loose around my waist and the bagginess around my neck was still there but was not a problem (I'm very narrow from shoulder to shoulder).  It is worth the money and it will be great for what I need it for.  HOWEVER, I'd be willing to pay more if they would put on-seam pockets (at least one pocket large enough for my phone).  Also, it would be nice if they had some patterned fabric because it is next to impossible to keep a solid color clean.  For now I am wearing an apron with pockets over it.  But I think I will start making my own dresses like this with pockets and using a patterned material.  Also, for a solid color, basic black would be an easier color to keep clean.

No, this is not the demnin because I've given up finding what I want.This dress seemed like a reasonable alternative.  Here is the breakdown of pro/con.Pro: Comfortable,  lightweight, has pockets (a BIG plus). It probably can handle a thin short sleeve top if needed (not an item in my wardrobe right now). I have kimono style cover ups that will work just fine.Con: Gaps in underarm (easily fixed). Price is a bit high IMHO.  This next point may just be buyer beware.  My issue is color. I bought the navy blue but am hard pressed to know if it is navy or black.  I had a similar problem with two J.Jill purchases of black and navy slacks. I had to write with permanent marker to be able to distinguish one from the other.  Just had my son weigh in and he said black and had a similar issue with Carhartt once.  Odds are whoever pulled it couldn't tell the difference either.Bottom Line? That's up to you. If they had a denim blue I'd buy again.  It hasn't been washed yet so that is a wait and see.P. S. I took a photo in natural light, it looked blue. Then I took one in the sunlight and it looked black.

I have actually purchased four of them in different colors, and I plan on purchasing more as long as the company keeps their price point at a reasonable rate as they have been doing. This is so smart of them to do this, because they actually sell more of these dresses than the ones that cost so much more. I absolutely will not buy others due to the ridiculous cost. These are made exceptionally well and are just so attractive on me. Every time I wear one I get multiple compliments, even from strangers at the grocery store. I have washed them multiple times on a cool gentle cycle and hung them to dry and they come out perfectly.  The buttons are metal and the only part of the dress that I might consider changing, as the metal buttons look kind of cheap on the dark solid colors, but are not even noticeable on the ones with a printed pattern. They can be dressed up with jewelry and a pretty sweater and the material is a nice quality and cool in the summer. I actually will wear some of these as the weather cools down with a warmer sweater and some boots. I haven’t had any problems with the fabric being thin or see through. They are fine in this respect. You need to purchase one of these dresses. You won’t be disappointed. I hope that this company continues to make these and keeps the pricing reasonable, so over time I can purchase more of them in different colors. I would not do this if they hiked the price way up. It would also be nice if they had a long sleeve version of this dress for winter or even more options with short sleeves, instead of sleeveless. Thanks to this dress, I have actually felt beautiful when I wear it and that is such a great feeling.Addendum: I read some other reviews about a seam ripping in this dress. I think if you just carelessly throw this in the washer with other clothes then they will put too much tension on these areas since this dress is longer than most dresses. The material for me is perfect, but lightweight which is great for the summer. If you wash it by itself on a cold water gentle cycle and hang it to dry then it should be fine. I have worn one of mine now at least 20 times and it still looks brand new. I love it so much that I take the extra precautions to keep it perfect. I do fluff it in the dryer by itself to remove any wrinkles before I put it on.",Absolutely the best,2023-07-19,5.0,RTAD0ZIU1RRFQ,TB,0.0,"VERY thin material and cheaply made, you'll need a slip with it which is asinine because who wears a slip nowadays The return process is a pain!

The dress fit perfectly, including the length, which hit about mid-calf (not hardly as long as pictured on the model).The dress does have elastic, which I am not a huge fan of, just below the bust.

But with two of the finest British actors ever, I had to watch this movie. Amazon's teaser describes it as ""wickedly funny and moving,"" but having seen the stage play years ago, I expected it to be more moving than funny, at least for me, and it was.McKellen is such a master at finding a fresh way to portray a character that still feels right, still feels like the character you've seen or read about before, only better, more multi-dimensional, but never overdone. The most diverse actor I can think of, McKellen can play anything from a clock (Beauty and the Beast) to a murderer (DaVinci Code). Here, there's a lot of diversity in one role, Norman. He pampers and cajoles his actor/boss, ""Sir,"" like a nursemaid. He threatens a young woman with violence and blackmail in order to protect Sir. Norman suffers so much pain because he wanted to act, but was never given the chance. He lives through Sir, grabbing a crumb of fulfillment here and there, as by his ability to recite any line in any Shakespearian play when Sir needs reminding. Yet Norman is insecure about making a simple pre-curtain announcement to the audience. In my opinion, Norman rivals Dickens' character Bradley Headstone for pathos, and is ideal for someone of McKellen's talent.Hopkins' Sir is 500% convincing as a man who is self-centered to the point of sociopathy. And now, the sociopath has dementia on top of it all! (And I wasn't just convinced because, sometimes, I looked at Sir's and saw Hannibal Lecter.) You don't like Sir, he infuriates you, yet you still feel sorry for him.The supporting actors are superb. I'd write more about them, but this is too long already.",These two couldn't miss,2018-06-10,5.0,R8SSRJMG5MYUX,Concerned About Movies,7.0,"I made the mistake of ordering the Blu-ray of this movie, but I'll probably return it. After noticing that the picture quality seemed no better than a regular DVD, I checked the disc. Sure enough, no Blu-ray symbol on the disc although the snap-case was clearly labled ""Blu-ray Disc"". Am I the only one this has happened to? Also, there is no menu on my disc and no extras. I tried everything to find a menu and/or a popup menu and/or subtitles and/or anything in addition to the movie, but couldn't ferret out anything. Despite this the back of the case clearly states that the disc contains ""Special Features --- 'From Stage to Screen' and 'Master & Assistant'."" To add insult to injury, the DVD looks suspiciously like a DVD-R, not a commercially produced DVD.As for this TV adaptation of the play ""The Dresser"", I don't think it holds up when compared to the 1983 movie adaptation starring Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. First of all, it seems to me that Ian McKellen was miscast as the dresser and, for the most part, I felt Anthony Hopkins failed to portray his character with the needed imperious yet vulnerable gravitas to make him both compelling and sympathetic. Don't get me wrong, I think both McKellen and Hopkins are both superb actors. But superb actors aren't necessarily superb in all parts. McKellen, especially, seemed to be unsuitable for his role. He does something with his voice that made a great deal of his dialogue unintelligible to this American, and his mincing around seemed to be a caricature of the person he played, rather than part of his identity. But Courtenay, in the 1983 movie adaptation, is spot on and completely believable. Every one of his lines (which are perfectly intelligible, by the way), and each one of his gestures, are impeccably interpreted and absolutely convincing.Ronald Harwood, who wrote the original play, actually was a dresser for the Shakespearean actor Sir Donald Wolfit upon whom Harwood based his play. Sir Wolfit's acting style on stage would undoubtedly be considered histrionic and hammy today, but it was an accepted convention and he was considered one of the finest Shakespearean actors of his time. Unlike Hopkins, Albert Finney captured that dated acting style perfectly when his character performed on stage. Also, unlike Hopkins, Finney's labored breathing and baleful sweating portrayed the actor as being dangerously infirm and on the verge of a heart attack throughout the movie. When Finney's character succumbs at the end of the movie it seems so poignant because we know that a great, but very flawed light has finally been extinguished and those who have been living in his shadow will now have to find their way in darkness. Hopkins, on the other hand, does sweat a lot but seemingly from exertion rather than from bad health, and his death at the end appeared to me to be more of a whimper than a gut-wrenching bang.The 1983 movie version was expanded to include scenes outside of the theater, and the play's dialogue was tightened. It was a ""movie version"" of the play, rather than the ""filmed play"" that we have here. Because it wasn't constrained to just the theater, I found the Finney / Courtenay adaptation to be more visually interesting. And personally, in this new Hopkins / McKellen adaptation I found the spacious dressing room of the star in this aging provincial theater to be improbable and distracting, given what little I know of British theater backstages. It appeared to be more like the set of stage play (which, I think, it was) rather than a real place. But perhaps I'm now swatting at gnats.However, the one really bright spot in this new movie adaptation is toward the end when Edward Fox (who plays Thornton) gives a moving speech to Hopkins. With the weight of forsakened dreams on his shoulders, Fox delivers each line, each word, with an underplayed and restrained emotion that tugs at your heart. Unfortunately, the film's editor kept cutting back to Hopkins during Fox's speech so, I suspect, we could see the effect the speech was having on ""Sir"". But at that point I didn't care, and I almost screamed at my television, ""Keep the dang camera on Fox for heaven's sake!"" For my money Edward Fox, who played a different part in the 1983 movie version, steals the whole show in that all-too-short scene and proves that ""there are no small parts, just small actors."" What a performance!I admit these are the mad ramblings of a non-professional critic. Take them for what they're worth. But my recommendation is that you buy the 1983 movieThe Dresser and skip this version. If you do decide to spend your hard earned money on this version, don't buy the Blu-ray",This Adaptation Was Okay But Uninspired.,2016-08-03,3.0

I ended up purchasing the size L which gives me a big more space and is a tad bigger, but I love the look of the top looking loose and the belt tied on the front compliments the look. It gives you some shape. Without the belt it’s just a straight a line dress. I purchased the red one and the the pattern is little birds. I love it! The dress fabric is a bit heavier than I expected, but I actually like it, it makes it feel more durable. I have been wearing this dress throughout the summer during 85-98 degree weather and I feel fresh, not very sweaty as with other fabrics. I hope this is helpful!

I have size 32/34J. It actually made my bust look a lot smaller in it than in most outfits. But you could wear with small bust too bc fabric is flowing....it is just really forgiving of both I think.Cons1) I wish there was a flap behind the buttons because when I sat down the dress wasn't even tight on me but my muffin top tummy (post several babies) and thighs spread and the slight pressure on the buttons gaped, basically you can see inside dress2) it looked kind of like a nightshirt on me. I don't know if it was the navy color? My husband said it was like the color was trying to be dressy but the style of dress was very casual.3) not sure why but my arms felt itchy after trying it on? Maybe something in the fabric that would need to be washed out of itSadly I had to return. It was probably one of the most comfortable dresses I have ever tried on (which is prob why it looked like a nightdress).

I hate to give these a low review because I love other UA products.  But this shoe has no support, little cushioning, and the upper is very poorly made.  The fabric is cheap and sewn poorly and there are not enough top holes for the laces.  I do agree that it is comfortable as soon as you slip it on - but that ends for me after a few walks.  It is also very breathable for hot weather - so much that you can see the color of your socks through the upper.  I cannot see how one could workout or run in these shoes nor stand on their feet all day on a hard surface.  A short walk around the neighborhood or in the backyard is about all these can stand.  Full disclosure - I'm male about 200 lbs and need stability and support.  If you don't weigh much and just need walking around shoes, you may like them.

So I bought another pair.Hey, if you can find better under worse conditions, by all means go for those, but if I need shoes now for a little cheap, I'm not going to mind going for what I know. What I will say is that they are not terribly comfortable after a while, to the point I had to get some Dr. Scholls soles to make them more bearable. The default soles are glued in, so if you are going to change them out, you should know about that.These are okay if you need something and don't want to experiment, but I also notice the usual price is like $50, which I don't know if I can recommend under such conditions, but these seem to stay on sale at $30, so that's a price I recommend.

For about a week. Until The Curse of the Monarch returned.To clarify, I first owed a pair of Monarchs around 15 years ago and wore those out too, and then bought replacements which were initially fine, but after a few days of casual wear they started to make squeaking/crunching sounds with every step. Kind of like I was walking on a carpet of mice and cornflakes. I tolerated this for many, many months but eventually replaced them with some cheap Adidas which gave me some relief from the embarrassment and taunting in the workplace, but in terms of foot comfort it was a dark time.Imagine my disappointment last month when my new (and very reasonably-priced) Nikes started making the exact same sounds after just a few days. Having gotten older and less tolerant of being ripped off I decided to send them back this time, figuring I could easily find another pair for the same price. Not so. Apparently Monarchs are generally $100+ right now so I looked elsewhere.I got the NB 608's from Amazon for around $70. Have to say, my first impression was good. These things look cool. Cooler than the Nikes. However, putting them on is kind of like stepping into an old bowling shoe vs getting a foot hug from a friendly Nike octopus. The sides of the NB's feel like cheap cardboard, and when you stand up and walk in them you get nothing like the bounce and support that you get from a Nike Air sole and a well-made leather upper.In conclusion, these are a decent shoe but a definite 6/10. Nike's equivalent is either a 7 or a 10, depending on nothing but dumb luck apparently - an associate at Shoe Carnival told me they have always seen good batches and bad batches and the squeak/crunch issue is well-known.Thanks as always to Amazon for great customer service.",New Balance 608 vs. Nike Air Monarch IV,2023-09-05,3.0

To my pleasant surprise, they were really nice, very well made, and wide enough that my feet don't hurt after wearing them for a few hours.It is hard to find shoes wide enough sometimes, and these are perfect, and don't make my foot look like I'm wearing a men's shoe.Very happy with my purchase!",Great Shoe!,2023-09-19,5.0,R7Y0E3RHFQCWU,Brittani,0.0,"This is my second pair.

My experience with these shoes was quite a journey, and I'm excited to share my insights with you.Firstly, the aesthetics of these shoes are undeniably appealing. They embody a clean and sleek style that can effortlessly transition from a casual day out to a business meeting. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication that elevates any outfit.The comfort level of these shoes is commendable. They offer the snug fit of a sneaker while maintaining the professional look of a dress shoe. However, I would recommend swapping out the original laces for smoother ones to enhance the overall comfort.The craftsmanship of these shoes is noteworthy. The design, the stitching, and the overall build quality reflect a high level of attention to detail. Moreover, the price point is quite attractive, making these shoes a great value for money.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few areas where these shoes could use some improvement.Pros:+ Stylish and versatile design: These shoes can easily transition between casual and professional settings.+ Comfort: They offer a level of comfort comparable to much more expensive shoes.+ Craftsmanship: The attention to detail and build quality are impressive.+ Price: They offer great value for money.Cons:- Color inconsistency: The grey color variant seems to resemble the blue one, which can be misleading.- Cushioning and arch support: The shoes could use more cushioning and better arch support. An insert might be necessary for extended wear.- Durability: Some users have reported issues with the upper part separating from the sole after a few months of use.- Heat retention: These shoes tend to retain heat, which might lead to sweaty feet after a few hours of wear.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Shoes are a stylish and affordable option for those seeking a versatile pair of shoes. However, potential buyers should be aware of the issues regarding comfort and durability. Despite these drawbacks, I believe these shoes offer good value for their price and can be a great addition to any wardrobe.",Navigating the Versatility of Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers,2023-07-28,4.0,R2HVYVJB3OADQA,Kevin Sutcliffe,0.0,These shoes look great and I was disappointed to return them.

They’re all made in China.If I was walking into the shoe store now, they will tell me that my size is a 6 1/2 but I don’t buy 6 1/2 I buy seven. I have a very high instep so a lot of shoes that are low in the middle won’t fit me correctly or they’ll rub blisters etc. After reading many reviews I’ve noticed that people that are wearing a 8 1/2 or larger are the majority of the people having issues with these shoes, so never buy shoes made in china without measuring your foot as they suggest. I know this firsthand because all my friends tell me I have cute shoes, but my shoe are at least three sizes smaller than theirs, and when they tried to buy the same style of shoe, it doesn’t fit a large foot. so with that being said, measure your foot before purchasing these shoes because they are cut to fit people with smaller feet.I personally love the shoes I think they’re really comfortable however, I’m usually wearing them out to eat or to run a quick errand. I’m not going hiking or wearing them at a wedding for six+ hours. So remember that these are made for cute activities that don’t last very long.

Not only does it offer exceptional comfort and support, but its sleek design and attention to detail make it a stylish choice as well.One of the standout features of the Puremotion shoe is its incredible comfort. The shoe’s cushioning system provides a plush feel, absorbing impact and reducing strain on my feet, even during long-distance runs. The responsive midsole ensures a smooth and energetic ride, enhancing my overall performance. The shoe also offers ample arch support, which has been a lifesaver for me as someone with high arches. It provides the right balance of stability and flexibility, promoting a natural stride.I also appreciate the lightweight construction of the Puremotion shoe. It feels almost weightless on my feet, allowing me to maintain a faster pace without feeling weighed down. The breathable upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and well-ventilated, preventing excessive sweating and discomfort during intense workouts. Additionally, the shoe’s flexible outsole adapts well to different surfaces, providing excellent traction and grip.The design of the Adidas Women’s Puremotion shoe is sleek and contemporary. The clean lines and minimalistic aesthetic give it a modern appeal that effortlessly transitions from a run to everyday wear. The variety of color options allows for personalization, catering to different style preferences. I have received numerous compliments on the shoe’s stylish look, both at the gym and while running errands.Durability is another strong suit of this shoe. The high-quality materials and solid construction ensure that it can withstand the demands of regular use. Even after several months of intense workouts and outdoor runs, the Puremotion shoe shows minimal signs of wear and tear, which speaks to its longevity.In conclusion, the Adidas Women’s Puremotion running shoe delivers on both performance and style. Its comfort, support, and lightweight design make it a go-to choice for runners of all levels. Whether you’re hitting the pavement or adding a touch of sporty fashion to your outfit, the Puremotion shoe is a reliable and fashionable companion for your active lifestyle.",Comfort and Style!!,2023-06-10,4.0,R1I3564Q8YJMV6,Ann,0.0,No support at all for running sneakers.

I’m talking $300 plus for American made shoes.  They are recraftable (resole-able) for another $100 each time.But since Covid, I don’t go to the office as often.  One of my black dress shoes needs to be re-soled, and it will be.  Just not now.So I ran into these shoes on Amazon.  It’s hard to argue with the price.  Literally 10% of what I have been paying.  So, are these shoes 90% lower in quality?The short, simple answer is, surprisingly, no.  Just the opposite.Upon receipt, I inspected them carefully and they looked pretty darned decent.  I was looking for any excuse to plop them back in the box and return them.  I couldn’t find anything.I appreciate that the leather upper is smooth and mildly shiny.  This is a wing tip style shoe, so I’m impressed that the extensive stitching was evenly spaced.  The leather detailing that I expect on a wing tip is also all there.Inside the shoe, it is lined from the toes all the way to the heel box… nice!  And that leather feels surprisingly supple.  That is something I would expect on a much more expensive shoe.  But definitely not at this price point.Hmm.I even liked the wax laces they chose.  They are a little thicker and have more than adequate length.  The shoe’s eyelets have interior facing metal grommets to protect against stretching and tear out of the leather and helps protect the laces against friction wear, as they are tightened and loosened over time.  Now having that detail, at this price point, has raised both of my eyebrows.Double hmm.  Now I am really impressed.The only thing that I didn’t like was that the stitching—that joins the uppers to the sole—is white.  I needed to polish these shoes anyway, so I figured I’d see what would happen if I put black polish on the stitching.I’m happy to say that the uppers shine up very nicely, to a high gloss.  This was done with just a little bit of buffing, using a traditional horse hair bristled brush.  And followed by a buffing cloth.  Although I didn’t do it, the leather is smooth enough that I  probably could have spit shined them.And those pesky white stitches on the top side of the soles?  Well I’m happy to report that they are now definitely black.Turning the shoe over, I can visually see a lump where the shank is supposed to be.  That’s a good thing. Not all shoes have a shank.  It helps to support the arch.  That’s another nice detail.  I am expecting the shank to be plastic at this price point.  So I am utterly shocked to report to you that a magnet sticks to the bottom of the shoe.  That shank is steel!  Now I am amazed!  We’re talking mind blown, Purple smoke everywhere.Speaking of details, I was very surprised to see the nicely done wing tip detailing, from on top of the shoe, carried over to the bottom of the sole.  Wow.  I have never seen that before.  That’s surprising.Now it is important to point out that the sole is some man made material.  Definitely not leather. But that’s okay.  Especially in the wet, leather wears out quickly, if you don’t wear rubber over shoes.  One less thing to fuss about.The heel itself has a band/layer of rust brown material sandwiched between black layers.  I wonder if that is a cork or bamboo material?  Having walked in these shoes, on concrete and tile floors, last week, there is a noticeable level of cush, or give. They will definitely not to be confused with sneakers.  But for dress shoes, this is a pleasant and surprising experience.The first day, I wore them at home, over the weekend and I’m glad I did that.  They needed time to adjust to my feet.  Any dress shoe that I have ever worn needs that.But after that, these shoes have been pleasant enough to walk around in at work.I’d have to say that these shoes give me at least 90% of what I would expect from my $300+ shoes for around 10% of the cost.In my estimation, at their current price point, they constitute an excellent deal.And especially if you are just breaking into the business world and need a good pair of interview shoes, these are definitely respectable… just be sure to put black polish on the white stitches.Oh, BTW, I have wider feet and I ordered the shoe wide.  After the initial stretching, they fit nicely.So, in the final analysis, what do I think?  I have to say, yes, these shoes definitely get my recommendation.  Especially if price is a huge factor, then these shoes constitute  an excellent deal.",Fantastic Shoe for the Price,2023-03-20,5.0,RAMJU9M6BAIG0,Mark G.,0.0,I really like the shoes but the size are definitely too big not a normal size.

I dig the look and I plan to use them for walking, work, and general casual use. I wanted something that I could potentially wear all day without discomfort and these seem perfect for that.The build quality is good, not excellent. It uses a faux suede material around the eyelets that looks a bit cheap. The toe box uses a formed knitted material which doesn't seem to be especially breathable (my ""light test"" showed very little light getting through) but it looks nice. There's a reflective strip with the logo on it, which I like. Compared to my expensive Altra running shoes and my Reebok cross-trainers, those shoes rely more on plasticky bits held on with glue. The overall quality of the Whitins is not far off the mark. The rubberized sole might be the first thing to wear out, as it's not especially thick. But compare that to Skechers which often go with a cheaper, less durable foam sole, and the Whitin soles look durable by comparison.If you plan to run in these, keep in mind that these are zero-drop shoes and while they have padding, it's probably not enough for people who run on their heels. It's best for fore/midfoot runners.It's really impressive that you can get something that looks nice and feels this good on your feet for such a low price.Fit: I'd go 1-1.5 sizes down from your usual.

What I will say is that they are not terribly comfortable after a while, to the point I had to get some Dr. Scholls soles to make them more bearable. The default soles are glued in, so if you are going to change them out, you should know about that.These are okay if you need something and don't want to experiment, but I also notice the usual price is like $50, which I don't know if I can recommend under such conditions, but these seem to stay on sale at $30, so that's a price I recommend.

For about a week. Until The Curse of the Monarch returned.To clarify, I first owed a pair of Monarchs around 15 years ago and wore those out too, and then bought replacements which were initially fine, but after a few days of casual wear they started to make squeaking/crunching sounds with every step. Kind of like I was walking on a carpet of mice and cornflakes. I tolerated this for many, many months but eventually replaced them with some cheap Adidas which gave me some relief from the embarrassment and taunting in the workplace, but in terms of foot comfort it was a dark time.Imagine my disappointment last month when my new (and very reasonably-priced) Nikes started making the exact same sounds after just a few days. Having gotten older and less tolerant of being ripped off I decided to send them back this time, figuring I could easily find another pair for the same price. Not so. Apparently Monarchs are generally $100+ right now so I looked elsewhere.I got the NB 608's from Amazon for around $70. Have to say, my first impression was good. These things look cool. Cooler than the Nikes. However, putting them on is kind of like stepping into an old bowling shoe vs getting a foot hug from a friendly Nike octopus. The sides of the NB's feel like cheap cardboard, and when you stand up and walk in them you get nothing like the bounce and support that you get from a Nike Air sole and a well-made leather upper.In conclusion, these are a decent shoe but a definite 6/10. Nike's equivalent is either a 7 or a 10, depending on nothing but dumb luck apparently - an associate at Shoe Carnival told me they have always seen good batches and bad batches and the squeak/crunch issue is well-known.Thanks as always to Amazon for great customer service.",New Balance 608 vs. Nike Air Monarch IV,2023-09-05,3.0

My experience with these shoes was quite a journey, and I'm excited to share my insights with you.Firstly, the aesthetics of these shoes are undeniably appealing. They embody a clean and sleek style that can effortlessly transition from a casual day out to a business meeting. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication that elevates any outfit.The comfort level of these shoes is commendable. They offer the snug fit of a sneaker while maintaining the professional look of a dress shoe. However, I would recommend swapping out the original laces for smoother ones to enhance the overall comfort.The craftsmanship of these shoes is noteworthy. The design, the stitching, and the overall build quality reflect a high level of attention to detail. Moreover, the price point is quite attractive, making these shoes a great value for money.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few areas where these shoes could use some improvement.Pros:+ Stylish and versatile design: These shoes can easily transition between casual and professional settings.+ Comfort: They offer a level of comfort comparable to much more expensive shoes.+ Craftsmanship: The attention to detail and build quality are impressive.+ Price: They offer great value for money.Cons:- Color inconsistency: The grey color variant seems to resemble the blue one, which can be misleading.- Cushioning and arch support: The shoes could use more cushioning and better arch support. An insert might be necessary for extended wear.- Durability: Some users have reported issues with the upper part separating from the sole after a few months of use.- Heat retention: These shoes tend to retain heat, which might lead to sweaty feet after a few hours of wear.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Shoes are a stylish and affordable option for those seeking a versatile pair of shoes. However, potential buyers should be aware of the issues regarding comfort and durability.

I know this firsthand because all my friends tell me I have cute shoes, but my shoe are at least three sizes smaller than theirs, and when they tried to buy the same style of shoe, it doesn’t fit a large foot. so with that being said, measure your foot before purchasing these shoes because they are cut to fit people with smaller feet.I personally love the shoes I think they’re really comfortable however, I’m usually wearing them out to eat or to run a quick errand.

Not only does it offer exceptional comfort and support, but its sleek design and attention to detail make it a stylish choice as well.One of the standout features of the Puremotion shoe is its incredible comfort. The shoe’s cushioning system provides a plush feel, absorbing impact and reducing strain on my feet, even during long-distance runs. The responsive midsole ensures a smooth and energetic ride, enhancing my overall performance. The shoe also offers ample arch support, which has been a lifesaver for me as someone with high arches. It provides the right balance of stability and flexibility, promoting a natural stride.I also appreciate the lightweight construction of the Puremotion shoe. It feels almost weightless on my feet, allowing me to maintain a faster pace without feeling weighed down. The breathable upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and well-ventilated, preventing excessive sweating and discomfort during intense workouts. Additionally, the shoe’s flexible outsole adapts well to different surfaces, providing excellent traction and grip.The design of the Adidas Women’s Puremotion shoe is sleek and contemporary. The clean lines and minimalistic aesthetic give it a modern appeal that effortlessly transitions from a run to everyday wear. The variety of color options allows for personalization, catering to different style preferences. I have received numerous compliments on the shoe’s stylish look, both at the gym and while running errands.Durability is another strong suit of this shoe. The high-quality materials and solid construction ensure that it can withstand the demands of regular use. Even after several months of intense workouts and outdoor runs, the Puremotion shoe shows minimal signs of wear and tear, which speaks to its longevity.In conclusion, the Adidas Women’s Puremotion running shoe delivers on both performance and style. Its comfort, support, and lightweight design make it a go-to choice for runners of all levels. Whether you’re hitting the pavement or adding a touch of sporty fashion to your outfit, the Puremotion shoe is a reliable and fashionable companion for your active lifestyle.",Comfort and Style!!,2023-06-10,4.0,R1I3564Q8YJMV6,Ann,0.0,No support at all for running sneakers.

I’m talking $300 plus for American made shoes.  They are recraftable (resole-able) for another $100 each time.But since Covid, I don’t go to the office as often.  One of my black dress shoes needs to be re-soled, and it will be.  Just not now.So I ran into these shoes on Amazon.  It’s hard to argue with the price.  Literally 10% of what I have been paying.  So, are these shoes 90% lower in quality?The short, simple answer is, surprisingly, no.  Just the opposite.Upon receipt, I inspected them carefully and they looked pretty darned decent.  I was looking for any excuse to plop them back in the box and return them.  I couldn’t find anything.I appreciate that the leather upper is smooth and mildly shiny.  This is a wing tip style shoe, so I’m impressed that the extensive stitching was evenly spaced.  The leather detailing that I expect on a wing tip is also all there.Inside the shoe, it is lined from the toes all the way to the heel box… nice!  And that leather feels surprisingly supple.  That is something I would expect on a much more expensive shoe.  But definitely not at this price point.Hmm.I even liked the wax laces they chose.  They are a little thicker and have more than adequate length.  The shoe’s eyelets have interior facing metal grommets to protect against stretching and tear out of the leather and helps protect the laces against friction wear, as they are tightened and loosened over time.  Now having that detail, at this price point, has raised both of my eyebrows.Double hmm.  Now I am really impressed.The only thing that I didn’t like was that the stitching—that joins the uppers to the sole—is white.  I needed to polish these shoes anyway, so I figured I’d see what would happen if I put black polish on the stitching.I’m happy to say that the uppers shine up very nicely, to a high gloss.  This was done with just a little bit of buffing, using a traditional horse hair bristled brush.  And followed by a buffing cloth.  Although I didn’t do it, the leather is smooth enough that I  probably could have spit shined them.And those pesky white stitches on the top side of the soles?  Well I’m happy to report that they are now definitely black.Turning the shoe over, I can visually see a lump where the shank is supposed to be.  That’s a good thing. Not all shoes have a shank.  It helps to support the arch.  That’s another nice detail.  I am expecting the shank to be plastic at this price point.  So I am utterly shocked to report to you that a magnet sticks to the bottom of the shoe.  That shank is steel!  Now I am amazed!  We’re talking mind blown, Purple smoke everywhere.Speaking of details, I was very surprised to see the nicely done wing tip detailing, from on top of the shoe, carried over to the bottom of the sole.  Wow.  I have never seen that before.  That’s surprising.Now it is important to point out that the sole is some man made material.  Definitely not leather. But that’s okay.  Especially in the wet, leather wears out quickly, if you don’t wear rubber over shoes.  One less thing to fuss about.The heel itself has a band/layer of rust brown material sandwiched between black layers.  I wonder if that is a cork or bamboo material?  Having walked in these shoes, on concrete and tile floors, last week, there is a noticeable level of cush, or give. They will definitely not to be confused with sneakers.  But for dress shoes, this is a pleasant and surprising experience.The first day, I wore them at home, over the weekend and I’m glad I did that.  They needed time to adjust to my feet.  Any dress shoe that I have ever worn needs that.But after that, these shoes have been pleasant enough to walk around in at work.I’d have to say that these shoes give me at least 90% of what I would expect from my $300+ shoes for around 10% of the cost.In my estimation, at their current price point, they constitute an excellent deal.And especially if you are just breaking into the business world and need a good pair of interview shoes, these are definitely respectable… just be sure to put black polish on the white stitches.Oh, BTW, I have wider feet and I ordered the shoe wide.  After the initial stretching, they fit nicely.So, in the final analysis, what do I think?  I have to say, yes, these shoes definitely get my recommendation.  Especially if price is a huge factor, then these shoes constitute  an excellent deal.",Fantastic Shoe for the Price,2023-03-20,5.0,RAMJU9M6BAIG0,Mark G.,0.0,I really like the shoes but the size are definitely too big not a normal size.

I dig the look and I plan to use them for walking, work, and general casual use. I wanted something that I could potentially wear all day without discomfort and these seem perfect for that.The build quality is good, not excellent. It uses a faux suede material around the eyelets that looks a bit cheap. The toe box uses a formed knitted material which doesn't seem to be especially breathable (my ""light test"" showed very little light getting through) but it looks nice. There's a reflective strip with the logo on it, which I like. Compared to my expensive Altra running shoes and my Reebok cross-trainers, those shoes rely more on plasticky bits held on with glue. The overall quality of the Whitins is not far off the mark. The rubberized sole might be the first thing to wear out, as it's not especially thick. But compare that to Skechers which often go with a cheaper, less durable foam sole, and the Whitin soles look durable by comparison.If you plan to run in these, keep in mind that these are zero-drop shoes and while they have padding, it's probably not enough for people who run on their heels. It's best for fore/midfoot runners.It's really impressive that you can get something that looks nice and feels this good on your feet for such a low price.Fit: I'd go 1-1.5 sizes down from your usual.

The ankle area of the shoe is sort soft material and sorta wrinkles at the opening and and the laces are at max tightness in order to give me almost a snug fit (also had to wear a sock or they would be to loose). Also feel a slight pronation inward because they are so flat inside and have no arch, I never have problems with probation in other shoes.

Gather 'round and listen to me tale of the running shoes fit for a swashbuckling pirate with one leg! Aye, ye see, this one-legged buccaneer, let's call 'im Captain Hook, had a score to settle with that cheeky lad, Peter Pan. And what better way to outrun that sprite than with a trusty pair of running shoes?Now, when Captain Pegleg Pete first laid his good eye on these shoes, he thought they were the missing treasure he'd been searching for. With their sleek design and magical promises of lightning-fast speed, he knew he had to give 'em a try. But here be the funny part, me mateys!As soon as Captain Hook slipped his wooden peg into those shoes, he went from landlubber to lightning bolt! It was as if the wind itself had decided to help him out. The sheer speed of his one-legged dash would make even the mermaids jealous. But there was one tiny problem—keeping balance on a single peg with such velocity is like trying to steer a ship in a hurricane!The poor captain found himself tumbling and rolling across the deck like a drunken sailor after a particularly wild night at the tavern. One moment he'd be racing towards Neverland, the next he'd be hugging the ground, trying to catch his breath and collect his dignity. The sight of a pirate with a pegleg spinning around like a whirling dervish is enough to make even the most hardened pirate chuckle.But don't ye worry, me hearties! Captain Pegleg Pete was no quitter. He quickly realized that the shoes were meant for nimble-footed landlubbers, not sea-loving pirates like himself. So, he took a moment to adjust his technique, channeling his inner acrobat and turning those trips into a wild pirate dance.Now, if ye ever find yerself near the coast of Neverland and ye spot a one-legged pirate zooming by in a pair of running shoes, don't ye be mistaken. That be Captain Pegleg Pete, putting on a show for the ages! With every misstep and stumble, he'll have ye in stitches, laughing so hard ye might just lose track of time.So, me hearties, if ye be a landlubber in need of a laugh and some fleet-footed entertainment, get yerself a pair of these running shoes. They may not help ye outrun Peter Pan, but they'll surely give ye a show ye won't soon forget. Just be sure to bring some popcorn and a sense of humor, for Captain Pegleg Pete's piratical antics are a treasure worth witnessing!

The exterior sole is very solid, thick and hard, though the insole is soft where it should be an supporting where needed. It arrived in a tight plastic hard shrink wrap, not a shoe box, but it was adequately protected in shipping. And I adore the rainbow color.A few weird items of note, especially from the attached tag that says it is a shoe for trail running, which is not something I do:1. The solid, thick bottom is a bit heavier than runners might prefer, though this is irrelevant for my uses.2. The tag also says ""avoid dampness,"" ""do not expose to the sun for a long time,"" and ""not above 30 degrees"" (Centigrade, which is mid-80s by that American method). This can be done only if it is limited to use on an indoor track or maybe while sleeping. Of course, living in a very hot & humid climate, I'll ignore this.3. At the Amazon web pages when I ordered, there was another brand for a few cents less in price, though this other listing used the exact same descriptions and pictures as Kricely, even showing the Kricely name on the shoes pictured. I have no idea what is going on, if it is a knock-off or what.4. Compared next to my other canvas-sneaker-style shoes, the added size seems to provide a bit more width instead of length, so the larger size doesn't make it a loose fit. Works good for me.I'll admit, I could almost say 5 stars. But who'd read that?

They are both extra comfortable and are off, and back on, in seconds. They do describe them as slip-ons but you can see they are not a house slipper for those who are complaining.

I was looking for a nonslip shoe for work that would fit my giant feet (size 16) that also wouldn’t cost me a fortune. I was nervous about these shoes when I got them because the laces cannot be tightened there pretty much just for show but they fit pretty good and don’t feel as if they are going to fall off. At this point I’ve been wearing them for about three months and they have held up ok. The bottom of the inside of the shoes has a padding that is starting to peel off a bit and there’s a seam on the inside by my toes that sometimes pokes a bit but nothing that makes them hurt to much to wear. For a cheep pair of work shoes they will do the job.Oh and the nonslip works great have had zero issues there and the fabric of the shoe makes them very breathable.,Better then I expected.,2023-09-16,4.0,R2XAMTN7C69NPI,Ronald D Knipple,1.0,Purchased these shoes because I work 11 hour shifts in a sushi restaurant.

I bought them with the intent to go hiking around since my hiking shoes were getting worn out and I wanted to try out something lighter weight. After they arrived, I spent about a week breaking them in before going out on any hikes. Even after a week of break-in, the outsoles were still surprisingly stiff but I did like the lightness and breathability of the shoe.I take these out on a first easy hike (<1.5mi and less than 100ft elevation gain) and was not impressed at all. The grip is not good on even dry, flat rock. They seem okay on a soft path, but as soon as I encountered any wetness, the grip is poor. Wet rocks are dangerous with these shoes and I nearly fell a few times on that first easy hike just walking around.I'm not sure what Saucony means by ""Trail Running Shoe"", but I don't think they are suitable even as a ""trail walking shoe"". I wouldn't use these for anything that isn't on a paved path.I have since decided that these shoes are not to ever be used for hiking again and have relegated them to daily wear (office job) and the gym. They are okay for that purpose. After a month, the insoles and midsoles are still too stiff and do not offer much arc support. Standing around in these shoes gets my feet aching in 30 minutes or less. They are decent for the gym since they are lightweight and breathable.Overall, I would not recommend these shoes for any purpose. There are much better options out there.","Good looks, lightweight, and breathable, but many downsides",2023-07-17,3.0

They are also very slippery when walking on wet and slick floors.

They also squeak like it’s no one’s business. I haven’t tried anything to really stop the squeaking, though I expected it to stop after a few weeks of wearing them every day. They have not stopped.

So, you can actually use the foot shape of the shoes to best benefit your walk, stability, and as pain free as you can be.  I have also told my brother about them.

While they do have some positive aspects, particularly in terms of comfort, there are certain areas where the quality and overall appearance fall short of my expectations.Starting with the positive, the barefoot style of these sneakers is something to appreciate. The minimalist design aims to mimic the feel of being barefoot, which is great for those who value natural movement and foot health. The wide fit is also a notable feature, providing ample room for toes to splay and ensuring a more comfortable experience.However, my reservations come in when evaluating the overall quality and appearance of the sneakers. The materials used, while functional, don't feel as premium as I had hoped. This affects both the durability and the overall aesthetics of the shoes. The build quality leaves a bit to be desired, and the appearance doesn't align with my personal taste.Furthermore, the design choices in terms of style and aesthetics aren't really in line with what I find visually appealing. This, of course, is subjective and may vary from person to person, but it's worth noting that the look of the sneakers didn't resonate with me.In terms of fit and comfort, these sneakers do offer a decent experience. The wide fit and the focus on mimicking a barefoot sensation contribute to a comfortable wear, especially for those who prioritize foot flexibility and natural movement.In conclusion, the WHITIN Men's Wide Minimalist Barefoot Sneakers provide a unique concept for those interested in a barefoot-style footwear experience. However, the overall quality and look weren't quite to my taste. While the comfort and fit aspects are commendable, the build quality and design didn't quite meet my expectations. It's worth considering your own preferences and priorities before making a decision on these sneakers.

Still, for the design and snug fit, the price is okay for me.  Comfort wise though, it's not soft enough for me.  I feel it's a bit stiff and I don't feel a nice bounce.  Maybe that's how proper court shoes are supposed to be, I'm not sure as I'm not really an expert on this.  I only know that I enjoy that soft cushiony feel whenever I step and test out a new shoe.

They aren't as well-known as Nike or Adidas, but they really live up to their slogan of being ""true to the sport"".I normally buy their mid-price runners. At ~25 miles per week, they last about 5 - 6 months and give good support on pavement, side roads or treadmills. I happened to spot these on sale this time and was excited to get a great deal on what looked to be a newer version of their Cohesion shoes.Long story short, these are definitely not Saucony's best shoes. They feel too light, like cheap shoes you'd find at Wal Mart. They also don't have the support I normally find with Saucony. They feel more spongey - like they won't stand up to distance-running.Only time will tell. I'm going to use them on my treadmill for now, but I definitely won't buy these again.

The Oxfords feature a sleek silhouette and high-quality leather craftsmanship that exude sophistication. Whether paired with formal attire or dressed down for a more casual look, these shoes consistently elevate my style.Beyond their aesthetics, the comfort level is exceptional. The cushioned insole provides excellent support throughout the day, making them ideal for long hours on my feet. Additionally, the outsole offers a confident grip, ensuring stability on various surfaces.I also appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction. It's evident that Clarks prioritizes durability, and I believe these shoes will stand the test of time.One minor aspect worth mentioning is the initial break-in period. Like most high-quality leather shoes, they required a few wears to conform to my feet perfectly. However, once they molded, the fit became incredibly comfortable.In conclusion, the Clarks Men's Oxford shoes offer a winning combination of style, comfort, and durability.

I got these shoes last May and wore them for almost every shift since then. Here's a review after 10 months of wearing these on concrete floors.Pros: these are non-slip. I am a clumsy person and I can tell you with confidence that I never slipped once while wearing these shoes, no matter how much water, milk or soap was on the floor.These shoes look nice, the all-over black look is very professional. If they get dirty, I just wiped them down with a cleaning wipe and they looked fine again.These shoes are water resistant, maybe even water proof. I have spilled so much hot coffee on them and my toes have remained dry and unburned.These shoes have no laces than need to be tied, so they cannot become untied and you won't trip on the laces.Cons: there is almost no support in these shoes. The sole is hard as a rock and your feet will hurt after working a full shift.Like all clothes, these loosen up over time. They are slip on shoes, so they're not really meant to be tight anyway, but there is noticeable gaping around my ankle now, my foot moves a lot in my shoe.The combination of a hard, flat sole and a loose fit is now causing me problems. My foot pain after work is now lasting several days, if I happen to have time off. I tried using an insole to add some cushion, but with such a loose shoe, the added bulk just made my foot slide off the insert, leading to a new kind of soreness after my shift.I've developed cuboid syndrome and require manual manipulation and wrapping to manage my pain. This may have been avoided if I replaced my shoes earlier, but I've always had a hard time with that. If there are no actual holes, I will keep wearing a pair of shoes.Would I buy these shoes again? Probably not these exact ones, but another pair from Sketchers, a pair with laces I can tighten as the shoe gets more worn. My advice is to skip these exact shoes, but stick with this brand. They are perfectly non-slip and water-resistant in my experience, but they require more padding, some arch support and definitely the ability to tighten them down the more you wear them.","Non-slip, water-resistant.

The fit of size L was perfect for my size 11 business shoes, which include wholecuts, Oxfords, double monk straps etc. I also own some of the higher-end brand shoe trees, and frankly do not see any difference in amount or quality of wood. The metal parts have the same thickness and springiness. Since one reviewer mentioned that they received 12 pieces for the left foot, which also were labeled 'L': yes, mine were also all labeled 'L'(arge), and there was no indication for left/right foot, but the shape clearly indicates what was right versus left. So, I received 6 pairs of size 'L', and I hope that this comment helps others in their decision to purchase this very good quality and very well priced 6-pack.Sidenote:These stretchers make a huge difference: they keep good leather dress shoes in shape (in particular those with leather soles), and the non-treated wood eliminates odors and traps moisture after wearing. Creases will form less quickly and the leather soles won't start bending upwards in the toe area.For these reasons, one should never wear the same pair of leather shoes the next day again. Trapped moisture and sweat will make the leather bulge and stretch out excessively, and the shoes will look worn out very quickly.","Good wood, identical to more pricey products",2023-08-18,5.0,R2AVL4WDQVQQVD,Amazon Customer,1.0,"I bought 6 ""pairs"" of shoe trees.

With a supination/over pronation (feet roll to the outside while walking) I needed a good shoe to help correct that along with my orthotics inserts. These fit the bill.They are solidly made, maybe even better than a pair of UA boots I had years ago, and are lightweight. I replaced the laces with elastic band laces for easier on and off as well so there’s no issues with them.

The first pair I purchased I measured my feet and it came to a 10 1/2, where I’ve traditionally been in an 11 1/2 to 12. So I bought the first pair and they did not fit at all.

I hate to give these a low review because I love other UA products.  But this shoe has no support, little cushioning, and the upper is very poorly made.  The fabric is cheap and sewn poorly and there are not enough top holes for the laces.  I do agree that it is comfortable as soon as you slip it on - but that ends for me after a few walks.  It is also very breathable for hot weather - so much that you can see the color of your socks through the upper.  I cannot see how one could workout or run in these shoes nor stand on their feet all day on a hard surface.  A short walk around the neighborhood or in the backyard is about all these can stand.  Full disclosure - I'm male about 200 lbs and need stability and support.  If you don't weigh much and just need walking around shoes, you may like them.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 because some folks may find these shoes are OK for what they need and they are in a good price range.

So I got these, and they are fine for what they cost. They are not perfect and I would recommend not using them under the same conditions I have, which is to say walk 5 miles a day in dusty, rocky terrain to and from work and stand for five hours in a greasy kitchen. I managed to get a quarter sized hole within 3 months. So I bought another pair.Hey, if you can find better under worse conditions, by all means go for those, but if I need shoes now for a little cheap, I'm not going to mind going for what I know. What I will say is that they are not terribly comfortable after a while, to the point I had to get some Dr. Scholls soles to make them more bearable. The default soles are glued in, so if you are going to change them out, you should know about that.These are okay if you need something and don't want to experiment, but I also notice the usual price is like $50, which I don't know if I can recommend under such conditions, but these seem to stay on sale at $30, so that's a price I recommend. In short, they're fine but they will need to be replaced if under enough pressure. They're good if you need something on a budget in a short time.",Buy for $30 or less,2023-06-29,3.0

Walker,1.0,"I wore out my old Monarchs that I had worn almost exclusively for years a few weeks ago.Ordered some new ones for about $50 on Amazon (great price) and was very happy with them. For about a week. Until The Curse of the Monarch returned.To clarify, I first owed a pair of Monarchs around 15 years ago and wore those out too, and then bought replacements which were initially fine, but after a few days of casual wear they started to make squeaking/crunching sounds with every step. Kind of like I was walking on a carpet of mice and cornflakes. I tolerated this for many, many months but eventually replaced them with some cheap Adidas which gave me some relief from the embarrassment and taunting in the workplace, but in terms of foot comfort it was a dark time.Imagine my disappointment last month when my new (and very reasonably-priced) Nikes started making the exact same sounds after just a few days. Having gotten older and less tolerant of being ripped off I decided to send them back this time, figuring I could easily find another pair for the same price. Not so. Apparently Monarchs are generally $100+ right now so I looked elsewhere.I got the NB 608's from Amazon for around $70. Have to say, my first impression was good. These things look cool. Cooler than the Nikes. However, putting them on is kind of like stepping into an old bowling shoe vs getting a foot hug from a friendly Nike octopus. The sides of the NB's feel like cheap cardboard, and when you stand up and walk in them you get nothing like the bounce and support that you get from a Nike Air sole and a well-made leather upper.In conclusion, these are a decent shoe but a definite 6/10. Nike's equivalent is either a 7 or a 10, depending on nothing but dumb luck apparently - an associate at Shoe Carnival told me they have always seen good batches and bad batches and the squeak/crunch issue is well-known.Thanks as always to Amazon for great customer service.",New Balance 608 vs. Nike Air Monarch IV,2023-09-05,3.0

My experience with these shoes was quite a journey, and I'm excited to share my insights with you.Firstly, the aesthetics of these shoes are undeniably appealing. They embody a clean and sleek style that can effortlessly transition from a casual day out to a business meeting. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication that elevates any outfit.The comfort level of these shoes is commendable. They offer the snug fit of a sneaker while maintaining the professional look of a dress shoe. However, I would recommend swapping out the original laces for smoother ones to enhance the overall comfort.The craftsmanship of these shoes is noteworthy. The design, the stitching, and the overall build quality reflect a high level of attention to detail. Moreover, the price point is quite attractive, making these shoes a great value for money.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few areas where these shoes could use some improvement.Pros:+ Stylish and versatile design: These shoes can easily transition between casual and professional settings.+ Comfort: They offer a level of comfort comparable to much more expensive shoes.+ Craftsmanship: The attention to detail and build quality are impressive.+ Price: They offer great value for money.Cons:- Color inconsistency: The grey color variant seems to resemble the blue one, which can be misleading.- Cushioning and arch support: The shoes could use more cushioning and better arch support. An insert might be necessary for extended wear.- Durability: Some users have reported issues with the upper part separating from the sole after a few months of use.- Heat retention: These shoes tend to retain heat, which might lead to sweaty feet after a few hours of wear.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Shoes are a stylish and affordable option for those seeking a versatile pair of shoes. However, potential buyers should be aware of the issues regarding comfort and durability.

Even during intense workouts or long-distance runs, I experienced minimal discomfort or fatigue. The ample padding and responsive cushioning absorbed impact effectively, allowing for a smooth and comfortable stride.One aspect that sets the Tubes 200 apart is the unique tube technology incorporated into the shoe's design.

Whether I was performing lateral movements or quick sprints, the shoes offered reliable traction and prevented any slippage. The flexibility of the shoe also allowed for natural foot movement, enabling a more efficient and fluid stride.Additionally, the durability of the Tubes 200 is impressive. The high-quality materials used in the construction of the shoes ensure long-lasting performance, even with frequent and rigorous use. The stitching and reinforcements contribute to the overall sturdiness, making these shoes an excellent investment that will withstand the test of time.Lastly, the sleek and stylish design of the Tubes 200 is worth mentioning.

I know this firsthand because all my friends tell me I have cute shoes, but my shoe are at least three sizes smaller than theirs, and when they tried to buy the same style of shoe, it doesn’t fit a large foot. so with that being said, measure your foot before purchasing these shoes because they are cut to fit people with smaller feet.I personally love the shoes I think they’re really comfortable however, I’m usually wearing them out to eat or to run a quick errand.

I’m talking $300 plus for American made shoes.  They are recraftable (resole-able) for another $100 each time.But since Covid, I don’t go to the office as often.  One of my black dress shoes needs to be re-soled, and it will be.  Just not now.So I ran into these shoes on Amazon.  It’s hard to argue with the price.  Literally 10% of what I have been paying.  So, are these shoes 90% lower in quality?The short, simple answer is, surprisingly, no.  Just the opposite.Upon receipt, I inspected them carefully and they looked pretty darned decent.  I was looking for any excuse to plop them back in the box and return them.  I couldn’t find anything.I appreciate that the leather upper is smooth and mildly shiny.  This is a wing tip style shoe, so I’m impressed that the extensive stitching was evenly spaced.  The leather detailing that I expect on a wing tip is also all there.Inside the shoe, it is lined from the toes all the way to the heel box… nice!  And that leather feels surprisingly supple.  That is something I would expect on a much more expensive shoe.  But definitely not at this price point.Hmm.I even liked the wax laces they chose.  They are a little thicker and have more than adequate length.  The shoe’s eyelets have interior facing metal grommets to protect against stretching and tear out of the leather and helps protect the laces against friction wear, as they are tightened and loosened over time.  Now having that detail, at this price point, has raised both of my eyebrows.Double hmm.  Now I am really impressed.The only thing that I didn’t like was that the stitching—that joins the uppers to the sole—is white.  I needed to polish these shoes anyway, so I figured I’d see what would happen if I put black polish on the stitching.I’m happy to say that the uppers shine up very nicely, to a high gloss.  This was done with just a little bit of buffing, using a traditional horse hair bristled brush.  And followed by a buffing cloth.  Although I didn’t do it, the leather is smooth enough that I  probably could have spit shined them.And those pesky white stitches on the top side of the soles?  Well I’m happy to report that they are now definitely black.Turning the shoe over, I can visually see a lump where the shank is supposed to be.  That’s a good thing. Not all shoes have a shank.  It helps to support the arch.  That’s another nice detail.  I am expecting the shank to be plastic at this price point.  So I am utterly shocked to report to you that a magnet sticks to the bottom of the shoe.  That shank is steel!  Now I am amazed!  We’re talking mind blown, Purple smoke everywhere.Speaking of details, I was very surprised to see the nicely done wing tip detailing, from on top of the shoe, carried over to the bottom of the sole.  Wow.  I have never seen that before.  That’s surprising.Now it is important to point out that the sole is some man made material.  Definitely not leather. But that’s okay.  Especially in the wet, leather wears out quickly, if you don’t wear rubber over shoes.  One less thing to fuss about.The heel itself has a band/layer of rust brown material sandwiched between black layers.  I wonder if that is a cork or bamboo material?  Having walked in these shoes, on concrete and tile floors, last week, there is a noticeable level of cush, or give. They will definitely not to be confused with sneakers.  But for dress shoes, this is a pleasant and surprising experience.The first day, I wore them at home, over the weekend and I’m glad I did that.  They needed time to adjust to my feet.  Any dress shoe that I have ever worn needs that.But after that, these shoes have been pleasant enough to walk around in at work.I’d have to say that these shoes give me at least 90% of what I would expect from my $300+ shoes for around 10% of the cost.In my estimation, at their current price point, they constitute an excellent deal.And especially if you are just breaking into the business world and need a good pair of interview shoes, these are definitely respectable… just be sure to put black polish on the white stitches.Oh, BTW, I have wider feet and I ordered the shoe wide.  After the initial stretching, they fit nicely.So, in the final analysis, what do I think?  I have to say, yes, these shoes definitely get my recommendation.  Especially if price is a huge factor, then these shoes constitute  an excellent deal.",Fantastic Shoe for the Price,2023-03-20,5.0,RAMJU9M6BAIG0,Mark G.,0.0,I really like the shoes but the size are definitely too big not a normal size.

I dig the look and I plan to use them for walking, work, and general casual use. I wanted something that I could potentially wear all day without discomfort and these seem perfect for that.The build quality is good, not excellent. It uses a faux suede material around the eyelets that looks a bit cheap. The toe box uses a formed knitted material which doesn't seem to be especially breathable (my ""light test"" showed very little light getting through) but it looks nice. There's a reflective strip with the logo on it, which I like. Compared to my expensive Altra running shoes and my Reebok cross-trainers, those shoes rely more on plasticky bits held on with glue. The overall quality of the Whitins is not far off the mark. The rubberized sole might be the first thing to wear out, as it's not especially thick. But compare that to Skechers which often go with a cheaper, less durable foam sole, and the Whitin soles look durable by comparison.If you plan to run in these, keep in mind that these are zero-drop shoes and while they have padding, it's probably not enough for people who run on their heels. It's best for fore/midfoot runners.It's really impressive that you can get something that looks nice and feels this good on your feet for such a low price.Fit: I'd go 1-1.5 sizes down from your usual.

Gather 'round and listen to me tale of the running shoes fit for a swashbuckling pirate with one leg! Aye, ye see, this one-legged buccaneer, let's call 'im Captain Hook, had a score to settle with that cheeky lad, Peter Pan. And what better way to outrun that sprite than with a trusty pair of running shoes?Now, when Captain Pegleg Pete first laid his good eye on these shoes, he thought they were the missing treasure he'd been searching for. With their sleek design and magical promises of lightning-fast speed, he knew he had to give 'em a try. But here be the funny part, me mateys!As soon as Captain Hook slipped his wooden peg into those shoes, he went from landlubber to lightning bolt! It was as if the wind itself had decided to help him out. The sheer speed of his one-legged dash would make even the mermaids jealous. But there was one tiny problem—keeping balance on a single peg with such velocity is like trying to steer a ship in a hurricane!The poor captain found himself tumbling and rolling across the deck like a drunken sailor after a particularly wild night at the tavern. One moment he'd be racing towards Neverland, the next he'd be hugging the ground, trying to catch his breath and collect his dignity. The sight of a pirate with a pegleg spinning around like a whirling dervish is enough to make even the most hardened pirate chuckle.But don't ye worry, me hearties! Captain Pegleg Pete was no quitter. He quickly realized that the shoes were meant for nimble-footed landlubbers, not sea-loving pirates like himself. So, he took a moment to adjust his technique, channeling his inner acrobat and turning those trips into a wild pirate dance.Now, if ye ever find yerself near the coast of Neverland and ye spot a one-legged pirate zooming by in a pair of running shoes, don't ye be mistaken. That be Captain Pegleg Pete, putting on a show for the ages! With every misstep and stumble, he'll have ye in stitches, laughing so hard ye might just lose track of time.So, me hearties, if ye be a landlubber in need of a laugh and some fleet-footed entertainment, get yerself a pair of these running shoes. They may not help ye outrun Peter Pan, but they'll surely give ye a show ye won't soon forget. Just be sure to bring some popcorn and a sense of humor, for Captain Pegleg Pete's piratical antics are a treasure worth witnessing!

The exterior sole is very solid, thick and hard, though the insole is soft where it should be an supporting where needed. It arrived in a tight plastic hard shrink wrap, not a shoe box, but it was adequately protected in shipping. And I adore the rainbow color.A few weird items of note, especially from the attached tag that says it is a shoe for trail running, which is not something I do:1. The solid, thick bottom is a bit heavier than runners might prefer, though this is irrelevant for my uses.2. The tag also says ""avoid dampness,"" ""do not expose to the sun for a long time,"" and ""not above 30 degrees"" (Centigrade, which is mid-80s by that American method). This can be done only if it is limited to use on an indoor track or maybe while sleeping. Of course, living in a very hot & humid climate, I'll ignore this.3. At the Amazon web pages when I ordered, there was another brand for a few cents less in price, though this other listing used the exact same descriptions and pictures as Kricely, even showing the Kricely name on the shoes pictured. I have no idea what is going on, if it is a knock-off or what.4. Compared next to my other canvas-sneaker-style shoes, the added size seems to provide a bit more width instead of length, so the larger size doesn't make it a loose fit. Works good for me.I'll admit, I could almost say 5 stars. But who'd read that?

They feel comfortable without feeling like I’m going to topple over (hokas). The only  thing I would “change” I guess is adding a last eye hole to tie them runners style. Also as I first went to tighten the laces I had to pull really hard to move the laces through the two middle loops. It even seemed that the laces were glued to the plastic.

But while they have thick soles, they are not soft at all.

They are both extra comfortable and are off, and back on, in seconds. They do describe them as slip-ons but you can see they are not a house slipper for those who are complaining. To put the shoe on (like after airport security for example) you just put your foot in (while standing if you want) and use a finger or two to pull the heel on - takes 1 second, and off you go on your merry way. No sitting and wasting time tying laces.Mostly though, they are really extra comfortable.

I bought them with the intent to go hiking around since my hiking shoes were getting worn out and I wanted to try out something lighter weight. After they arrived, I spent about a week breaking them in before going out on any hikes. Even after a week of break-in, the outsoles were still surprisingly stiff but I did like the lightness and breathability of the shoe.I take these out on a first easy hike (<1.5mi and less than 100ft elevation gain) and was not impressed at all. The grip is not good on even dry, flat rock. They seem okay on a soft path, but as soon as I encountered any wetness, the grip is poor. Wet rocks are dangerous with these shoes and I nearly fell a few times on that first easy hike just walking around.I'm not sure what Saucony means by ""Trail Running Shoe"", but I don't think they are suitable even as a ""trail walking shoe"". I wouldn't use these for anything that isn't on a paved path.I have since decided that these shoes are not to ever be used for hiking again and have relegated them to daily wear (office job) and the gym. They are okay for that purpose. After a month, the insoles and midsoles are still too stiff and do not offer much arc support. Standing around in these shoes gets my feet aching in 30 minutes or less. They are decent for the gym since they are lightweight and breathable.Overall, I would not recommend these shoes for any purpose. There are much better options out there.","Good looks, lightweight, and breathable, but many downsides",2023-07-17,3.0

I got these because I was interested in the waterproof element as well as the material they’re made out of. For the most part, they’re comfortable and somewhat breathable. They are not water proof or water resistant at all. I have dropped cold water and hot water on my feet and they just suck the fluid right up. They are also very slippery when walking on wet and slick floors. Which is a concern because if they’re marketed as waterproof and you see pictures in their product photos of people walking through streams, you’d think they’d have some grip. They do not. They also squeak like it’s no one’s business. I haven’t tried anything to really stop the squeaking, though I expected it to stop after a few weeks of wearing them every day. They have not stopped. Some pros: pet hair and dirt don’t stick to them like some of the cheaper canvas shoes.as for the size chart, get what size you normally wear. I measured my feet and originally for a different style with those measurements (which was 7.5, I’m normally an 8 in womens, aka eu39) and it was too small. BUY THE SIZE THAT YOU NORMALLY WEAR.

But I'd still have a constant painful squeezing around my toes. My big toe joints and pinky toes were still being forced inward even when not walking. I didn't know what I could do to be able to walk pain free. After some research I found Foot Shaped Minimalist shoes. So, I decided to try them.  My first pair i ordered, what I thought would fit me. I didn't measure my feet. What i got were to large. So, I gave them to my mother to try. Which happened to fit her perfectly. She is so Happy to no longer have painful swollen feet and ankles at the end of the day. She has decided to order 2 more pairs for herself and toss out the hundred dollars plus shoes that promised pain free feet, but never relieved her pain. My mother is diabetic.  I got her toe socks with her shoes. Before, she was unable to touch her toes due to sharp pain. She has noticed that when she lotions her feet. Her pain is getting less and less as the days go by.  I ordered my pair After i took my feet measurements ordered. I absolutely love my shoes. But I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, you also purchase toe socks. So, you can actually use the foot shape of the shoes to best benefit your walk, stability, and as pain free as you can be.  I have also told my brother about them. He actually got his pair not long ago. He is enjoying them. He also had the same problem as myself with finding shoes that are wide enough around the toes.  I got a pair for my husband. He is in the beginning stages of getting a bunion. He has stated. That he keeps forgetting he even has shoes on. The kids are next on the list to Foot Shaped Minimalist shoes.

While they do have some positive aspects, particularly in terms of comfort, there are certain areas where the quality and overall appearance fall short of my expectations.Starting with the positive, the barefoot style of these sneakers is something to appreciate. The minimalist design aims to mimic the feel of being barefoot, which is great for those who value natural movement and foot health. The wide fit is also a notable feature, providing ample room for toes to splay and ensuring a more comfortable experience.However, my reservations come in when evaluating the overall quality and appearance of the sneakers. The materials used, while functional, don't feel as premium as I had hoped. This affects both the durability and the overall aesthetics of the shoes. The build quality leaves a bit to be desired, and the appearance doesn't align with my personal taste.Furthermore, the design choices in terms of style and aesthetics aren't really in line with what I find visually appealing. This, of course, is subjective and may vary from person to person, but it's worth noting that the look of the sneakers didn't resonate with me.In terms of fit and comfort, these sneakers do offer a decent experience. The wide fit and the focus on mimicking a barefoot sensation contribute to a comfortable wear, especially for those who prioritize foot flexibility and natural movement.In conclusion, the WHITIN Men's Wide Minimalist Barefoot Sneakers provide a unique concept for those interested in a barefoot-style footwear experience. However, the overall quality and look weren't quite to my taste. While the comfort and fit aspects are commendable, the build quality and design didn't quite meet my expectations. It's worth considering your own preferences and priorities before making a decision on these sneakers.

I only use it for pickleball games and nothing else and it's still pristine white but I'm always wary that the tear might grow big and so I'm always careful not to bend it.  Still, for the design and snug fit, the price is okay for me.  Comfort wise though, it's not soft enough for me.  I feel it's a bit stiff and I don't feel a nice bounce.  Maybe that's how proper court shoes are supposed to be, I'm not sure as I'm not really an expert on this.  I only know that I enjoy that soft cushiony feel whenever I step and test out a new shoe.  Weight wise, they are light though and the grip on the floor is also good.

I've exclusively worn Saucony running shoes since about the first year, so I have plenty of experience with their shoes. They make a wide range of running shoes with a wide price range to match. They aren't as well-known as Nike or Adidas, but they really live up to their slogan of being ""true to the sport"".I normally buy their mid-price runners. At ~25 miles per week, they last about 5 - 6 months and give good support on pavement, side roads or treadmills. I happened to spot these on sale this time and was excited to get a great deal on what looked to be a newer version of their Cohesion shoes.Long story short, these are definitely not Saucony's best shoes. They feel too light, like cheap shoes you'd find at Wal Mart. They also don't have the support I normally find with Saucony. They feel more spongey - like they won't stand up to distance-running.Only time will tell. I'm going to use them on my treadmill for now, but I definitely won't buy these again.

These shoes effortlessly blend classic elegance with unmatched comfort, making them a perfect addition to any wardrobe.The first thing that caught my attention was the timeless design. The Oxfords feature a sleek silhouette and high-quality leather craftsmanship that exude sophistication. Whether paired with formal attire or dressed down for a more casual look, these shoes consistently elevate my style.Beyond their aesthetics, the comfort level is exceptional. The cushioned insole provides excellent support throughout the day, making them ideal for long hours on my feet. Additionally, the outsole offers a confident grip, ensuring stability on various surfaces.I also appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction. It's evident that Clarks prioritizes durability, and I believe these shoes will stand the test of time.One minor aspect worth mentioning is the initial break-in period. Like most high-quality leather shoes, they required a few wears to conform to my feet perfectly. However, once they molded, the fit became incredibly comfortable.In conclusion, the Clarks Men's Oxford shoes offer a winning combination of style, comfort, and durability. Whether for formal events or daily wear, they consistently deliver a polished and refined look.

I got these shoes last May and wore them for almost every shift since then. Here's a review after 10 months of wearing these on concrete floors.Pros: these are non-slip. I am a clumsy person and I can tell you with confidence that I never slipped once while wearing these shoes, no matter how much water, milk or soap was on the floor.These shoes look nice, the all-over black look is very professional. If they get dirty, I just wiped them down with a cleaning wipe and they looked fine again.These shoes are water resistant, maybe even water proof. I have spilled so much hot coffee on them and my toes have remained dry and unburned.These shoes have no laces than need to be tied, so they cannot become untied and you won't trip on the laces.Cons: there is almost no support in these shoes. The sole is hard as a rock and your feet will hurt after working a full shift.Like all clothes, these loosen up over time. They are slip on shoes, so they're not really meant to be tight anyway, but there is noticeable gaping around my ankle now, my foot moves a lot in my shoe.The combination of a hard, flat sole and a loose fit is now causing me problems. My foot pain after work is now lasting several days, if I happen to have time off. I tried using an insole to add some cushion, but with such a loose shoe, the added bulk just made my foot slide off the insert, leading to a new kind of soreness after my shift.I've developed cuboid syndrome and require manual manipulation and wrapping to manage my pain. This may have been avoided if I replaced my shoes earlier, but I've always had a hard time with that. If there are no actual holes, I will keep wearing a pair of shoes.Would I buy these shoes again? Probably not these exact ones, but another pair from Sketchers, a pair with laces I can tighten as the shoe gets more worn. My advice is to skip these exact shoes, but stick with this brand. They are perfectly non-slip and water-resistant in my experience, but they require more padding, some arch support and definitely the ability to tighten them down the more you wear them.","Non-slip, water-resistant.

The fit of size L was perfect for my size 11 business shoes, which include wholecuts, Oxfords, double monk straps etc. I also own some of the higher-end brand shoe trees, and frankly do not see any difference in amount or quality of wood. The metal parts have the same thickness and springiness. Since one reviewer mentioned that they received 12 pieces for the left foot, which also were labeled 'L': yes, mine were also all labeled 'L'(arge), and there was no indication for left/right foot, but the shape clearly indicates what was right versus left. So, I received 6 pairs of size 'L', and I hope that this comment helps others in their decision to purchase this very good quality and very well priced 6-pack.Sidenote:These stretchers make a huge difference: they keep good leather dress shoes in shape (in particular those with leather soles), and the non-treated wood eliminates odors and traps moisture after wearing. Creases will form less quickly and the leather soles won't start bending upwards in the toe area.For these reasons, one should never wear the same pair of leather shoes the next day again. Trapped moisture and sweat will make the leather bulge and stretch out excessively, and the shoes will look worn out very quickly.","Good wood, identical to more pricey products",2023-08-18,5.0,R2AVL4WDQVQQVD,Amazon Customer,1.0,"I bought 6 ""pairs"" of shoe trees.

Cute colors and I love ASICS fit, and how lightweight they are, but they didn’t match listing photo. You can see in my photos that they were even pre-tested for wear outdoors, which would be the place I would wear them because ASICS shoes are great for running or walking on any terrain. The shock absorption on trails and pavement is great.Colors were more black/dark green. I thought they would be black and light, sea foam green. Since I was needing them for a specific match to a new outfit, which these didn’t work with, I had to return them as soon as I saw they weren’t what I thought I was getting. Bummer because I truly enjoy ASICS shoes!Fit was as expected for my size, so if you’ve worn ASICS, go with your usual size. These had the added bonus of a nice “broken in” feel in look and comfort. Laces were already tied up, so gotta love that time saving feature!

The foam feels very unresponsive and stiff but no blisters or pain so clearly a well built shoe but I'm probably not heavy enough to maximize the use of the foam. My dad who weightsmore than me really loved  them all though with his age now his runs consists more of walking than running.The size chart is also not the actual size the one on their website is more accurate but has the same issue of being based off foot length so the size us 8.5-9.5 is closer to a us 10-11 respectively for me who wears a us size 9 a 7.5-8 was closer to the actual size. I recommend  buying  based off the insole length of one of your  old shoes.Although  this shoe  is great definitely recommend  the one mix creami over this one if you're looking for a regular everyday shoe or even a daily trainer.

They'll last me years because I take good care of them. If you are a connoisseur of shoes, then you know your shoes. I know that it's rare to find a good pair of Oxfords/dress shoes online (or otherwise) for the price of these, but they have their good points.I've owned a lot of Oxfords that I wear to work. One scuff, and the cow that gave their life for your shoe is rolling around in their grave. They're super difficult to remove! And don't let it be those shoes that look wonderful online, but when you get them, they smell like gasoline for years. Why would I continue purchasing shoes that cause my automobile and office to smell like gas, that cause my tonsils to swell? I didn't just mow the lawn with these, you know. Shoes should be ready-to-wear out the box... I DENOUNCE the idea that I should 'leave my shoes outside' or put them in a bag of sodium bicarb to get rid of the horrible smell! Never again! Okay. Back to my review of these shoes. :}These shoes... well, you get what you pay for.The pros:1). Comfortable2). Not easy to scuff3). Flexible and durable; upper, inner, and bottom4). Cheap (compared to leather shoes). Damage? Easy to replace.5). No sickening my-shoes-just-went-on-a-date-with-the-gasoline-nozzle-while-the-gas-was-running smell.6). Nice, medium width7). Tasteful style8). Not easy to stain9). Super-light! You won't even notice you're wearing them.The cons:1). They are too large. I had to return my original order and reorder one size down (from 13"" to 12"")2). Poorly made; I don't believe the string at the bottom of the shoe is actually used for attachment to the shoe itself. I had to send the shoe back (again) AFTER ordering one size down because the thread was quite loose from it's intended space at the bottom. You could literally pull the string with your finger, let alone a pair of tweezers. I believe they're glued. The sewing machine (or person) used to make these shoes look like the thread is functional needs to be recalibrated.3). The hue of color between the shoe/sole/bottom isn't consistent. It seems that someone hired their child of 7 or less years of age, gave them an unscented marker, and asked them to 'Have at it' with their non-dominant hand. One of the pairs I sent back looked like someone scuffed the front of one of the shoes, slapped it back in the box, resent to another customer. With every pair I had to send back, I kept my fingers crossed that the next pair would be better. But, it's what you get when you pay for shoes like these (rolling my eyes).4). Lack of ventilation. Leather breathes, these do not. I feel like my feet need an asthma pump after a day of keeping these bad boys on.5). Slippery bottoms. You literally may benefit from standing on the road and scraping the bottom to get a little bit of 'grip' on them. This is a half-con because eventually, it gets better within the week.Overall, these shoes are decent for the price. I've not owned non-leather shoes for years, but these are worth being in my closet. I have a black pair and a brown pair, and my review is the same for both of them. I had to send the black pair back about 3 times (size, damaged product, damaged product), but at the end, I'm satisfied.

I've had no problems with them, they fit great and I haven't seen any quality issues, no seams coming apart. If they made a version of these with a stiffer rock plate insert in them they'd be my perfect trail running shoe. Unfortunately the trails I run on are so rocky, that I am looking for another shoe with more protection. I am very careful how I run and where I step and I don't injure my heels as I land flat footed or on my toes. But some parts of the trails I run on there is nowhere to go to avoid golf ball sized rocks and I tend to hurt the balls of my feet as the rocks really poke through. You can definitely feel the trail and have great control, I have no worries about ankle sprains which has plagued me in the past before I went with minimal shoes. But the shoes are so flexible the impact of the rocks are starting to tear up the bottom of the insert and the minor injuries are keeping me from running as much as I'd like.

Based on prior reviews, many people clearly like these.  But they didn't work for me.This was my first experience with this kind of shoe.  In my 72 years, I've worn dress shoes, athletic shoes, sandals (Chacos are my top), and boots of all kind.  But never anything like this.  But I wanted something light weight for workouts with my flow ropes, so thought I'd try these out.UPS delivered mine about 11 am this morning. I wore them around my apartment for a few hours on hardwood floors, a bit of carpet, and a rubber kitchen mat.  By 3 pm, I'd decided to return them.  There are multiple reasons why, in no particular order.1) They are a PITA to put on.  Since there is no tongue, they don't open wide like shoes with a real tongue.  Worse, the loop on the back above the heel is so small that getting my index finger into it was difficult -- and I have small hands for man (I wear size small gloves).  If both ends of the loop were sewn on the outside, it would work.  But one end is outside, the other end inside, so it straddles the edge.2) I've been wearing size 9 everything for decades.  So I purchased size 9 (42) because they are reportedly true to size.  But these were at least an inch too long for me.  I guess I could have lived with it, but ...3) I laced them up very loosely -- actually time with the laces completely untied -- yet they felt very tight across the top of my foot (the ""bridge"" just forward from my ankle).  And that's even with my narrow feet (I'm a 9A.)  When sitting or lying in my hammock, I felt that my foot was going to go to sleep -- that tingling sensation.  I was wearing a lightweight sock -- lightest I had, so that contributed.  I know that most people wear these without socks, but I hate that, and these were not comfortable on my bare skin at all.  I suppose I could have ordered some thin, dress socks, but I really never wear that kind.4) This last factor is what made me decide to return them.  The top of the opening -- a lightly padded ""ridge"" -- rubs against my ankle on the outside of my foot -- the ankle ""bump"".  It was starting to chafe after only moderate movement (dance movements to simulate exercise).So, again, I'm not knocking the design -- lots of people like them -- nor the quality of materials or workmanship.  But they didn't work for me.  I'm going to order a new pair of Chacos and call it good.","Good quality shoes, but they didn't work for me",2023-02-24,3.0

So this review comes soon after purchase, I might try an update after 6 months to see if perspectives change.The good, these boots are really comfortable and lightweight to wear. If you didn’t look at them you could almost think they are sneakers. So far, the waterproof capability is good straight from Columbia and I have walked several days in a row in wet grassy trails and my wool socks were bone dry.The bad, these might be specific to my situation but I wanted to put it out there. The tread pattern on the soles is spaced very wide and the material is quite soft (which makes them very comfortable to walk in); this poses a problem for the honey locust trees on our property which puncture tires and go through soles like a hot knife through butter. I’m worried the durability of these soles will not be the best. Another personal dislike is the cheap laces, I quickly put a good pair of leather laces on them and they stay secured much better.

It is also very breathable for hot weather - so much that you can see the color of your socks through the upper.  I cannot see how one could workout or run in these shoes nor stand on their feet all day on a hard surface.  A short walk around the neighborhood or in the backyard is about all these can stand.  Full disclosure - I'm male about 200 lbs and need stability and support.  If you don't weigh much and just need walking around shoes, you may like them.

So I bought another pair.Hey, if you can find better under worse conditions, by all means go for those, but if I need shoes now for a little cheap, I'm not going to mind going for what I know. What I will say is that they are not terribly comfortable after a while, to the point I had to get some Dr. Scholls soles to make them more bearable. The default soles are glued in, so if you are going to change them out, you should know about that.These are okay if you need something and don't want to experiment, but I also notice the usual price is like $50, which I don't know if I can recommend under such conditions, but these seem to stay on sale at $30, so that's a price I recommend.

For about a week. Until The Curse of the Monarch returned.To clarify, I first owed a pair of Monarchs around 15 years ago and wore those out too, and then bought replacements which were initially fine, but after a few days of casual wear they started to make squeaking/crunching sounds with every step. Kind of like I was walking on a carpet of mice and cornflakes. I tolerated this for many, many months but eventually replaced them with some cheap Adidas which gave me some relief from the embarrassment and taunting in the workplace, but in terms of foot comfort it was a dark time.Imagine my disappointment last month when my new (and very reasonably-priced) Nikes started making the exact same sounds after just a few days. Having gotten older and less tolerant of being ripped off I decided to send them back this time, figuring I could easily find another pair for the same price. Not so. Apparently Monarchs are generally $100+ right now so I looked elsewhere.I got the NB 608's from Amazon for around $70. Have to say, my first impression was good. These things look cool. Cooler than the Nikes. However, putting them on is kind of like stepping into an old bowling shoe vs getting a foot hug from a friendly Nike octopus. The sides of the NB's feel like cheap cardboard, and when you stand up and walk in them you get nothing like the bounce and support that you get from a Nike Air sole and a well-made leather upper.In conclusion, these are a decent shoe but a definite 6/10. Nike's equivalent is either a 7 or a 10, depending on nothing but dumb luck apparently - an associate at Shoe Carnival told me they have always seen good batches and bad batches and the squeak/crunch issue is well-known.Thanks as always to Amazon for great customer service.",New Balance 608 vs. Nike Air Monarch IV,2023-09-05,3.0

My experience with these shoes was quite a journey, and I'm excited to share my insights with you.Firstly, the aesthetics of these shoes are undeniably appealing. They embody a clean and sleek style that can effortlessly transition from a casual day out to a business meeting. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication that elevates any outfit.The comfort level of these shoes is commendable. They offer the snug fit of a sneaker while maintaining the professional look of a dress shoe. However, I would recommend swapping out the original laces for smoother ones to enhance the overall comfort.The craftsmanship of these shoes is noteworthy. The design, the stitching, and the overall build quality reflect a high level of attention to detail. Moreover, the price point is quite attractive, making these shoes a great value for money.However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are a few areas where these shoes could use some improvement.Pros:+ Stylish and versatile design: These shoes can easily transition between casual and professional settings.+ Comfort: They offer a level of comfort comparable to much more expensive shoes.+ Craftsmanship: The attention to detail and build quality are impressive.+ Price: They offer great value for money.Cons:- Color inconsistency: The grey color variant seems to resemble the blue one, which can be misleading.- Cushioning and arch support: The shoes could use more cushioning and better arch support. An insert might be necessary for extended wear.- Durability: Some users have reported issues with the upper part separating from the sole after a few months of use.- Heat retention: These shoes tend to retain heat, which might lead to sweaty feet after a few hours of wear.In conclusion, the Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Shoes are a stylish and affordable option for those seeking a versatile pair of shoes. However, potential buyers should be aware of the issues regarding comfort and durability. Despite these drawbacks, I believe these shoes offer good value for their price and can be a great addition to any wardrobe.",Navigating the Versatility of Bruno Marc Men's Oxfords Sneakers,2023-07-28,4.0,R2HVYVJB3OADQA,Kevin Sutcliffe,0.0,These shoes look great and I was disappointed to return them.

These shoes are a true testament to K-Swiss's commitment to quality, comfort, and performance. Whether you're hitting the gym or going for a run, these training shoes deliver exceptional results.First and foremost, the comfort provided by the Tubes 200 is unmatched. The shoes feature a cushioned and supportive insole that molds to the contours of your feet, providing a snug and personalized fit. Even during intense workouts or long-distance runs, I experienced minimal discomfort or fatigue. The ample padding and responsive cushioning absorbed impact effectively, allowing for a smooth and comfortable stride.One aspect that sets the Tubes 200 apart is the unique tube technology incorporated into the shoe's design. The Tubes technology consists of individual cushioning tubes strategically placed in the midsole, providing targeted support and shock absorption. This innovative feature not only enhances comfort but also promotes stability and reduces the risk of injury. I noticed a significant improvement in my overall foot and ankle support while wearing these shoes.In terms of performance, the Tubes 200 truly shines.

I know this firsthand because all my friends tell me I have cute shoes, but my shoe are at least three sizes smaller than theirs, and when they tried to buy the same style of shoe, it doesn’t fit a large foot. so with that being said, measure your foot before purchasing these shoes because they are cut to fit people with smaller feet.I personally love the shoes I think they’re really comfortable however, I’m usually wearing them out to eat or to run a quick errand.

Will I buy them again?Yes, as you can see in the photo, I have bought many.But remember if you’re buying a shoe for $20 don’t expect it to last as long as the Olympics!!Happy 😊 shopping 🛒",Remember you were buying shoes from China they are not created equally to the US shoes so size up 🔝,2023-09-14,5.0,RD946E26373JS,Olga,0.0,"I love the look of these ballerina shoes, they look so cute with my double skirts and boho style, however, if you expect to unzipper these shoes to be able to wear them, then you can forget about them, as the zipper does not work.

Not only does it offer exceptional comfort and support, but its sleek design and attention to detail make it a stylish choice as well.One of the standout features of the Puremotion shoe is its incredible comfort. The shoe’s cushioning system provides a plush feel, absorbing impact and reducing strain on my feet, even during long-distance runs. The responsive midsole ensures a smooth and energetic ride, enhancing my overall performance. The shoe also offers ample arch support, which has been a lifesaver for me as someone with high arches. It provides the right balance of stability and flexibility, promoting a natural stride.I also appreciate the lightweight construction of the Puremotion shoe. It feels almost weightless on my feet, allowing me to maintain a faster pace without feeling weighed down. The breathable upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and well-ventilated, preventing excessive sweating and discomfort during intense workouts. Additionally, the shoe’s flexible outsole adapts well to different surfaces, providing excellent traction and grip.The design of the Adidas Women’s Puremotion shoe is sleek and contemporary. The clean lines and minimalistic aesthetic give it a modern appeal that effortlessly transitions from a run to everyday wear. The variety of color options allows for personalization, catering to different style preferences. I have received numerous compliments on the shoe’s stylish look, both at the gym and while running errands.Durability is another strong suit of this shoe. The high-quality materials and solid construction ensure that it can withstand the demands of regular use. Even after several months of intense workouts and outdoor runs, the Puremotion shoe shows minimal signs of wear and tear, which speaks to its longevity.In conclusion, the Adidas Women’s Puremotion running shoe delivers on both performance and style. Its comfort, support, and lightweight design make it a go-to choice for runners of all levels. Whether you’re hitting the pavement or adding a touch of sporty fashion to your outfit, the Puremotion shoe is a reliable and fashionable companion for your active lifestyle.",Comfort and Style!!,2023-06-10,4.0,R1I3564Q8YJMV6,Ann,0.0,No support at all for running sneakers.

I’m talking $300 plus for American made shoes.  They are recraftable (resole-able) for another $100 each time.But since Covid, I don’t go to the office as often.  One of my black dress shoes needs to be re-soled, and it will be.  Just not now.So I ran into these shoes on Amazon.  It’s hard to argue with the price.  Literally 10% of what I have been paying.  So, are these shoes 90% lower in quality?The short, simple answer is, surprisingly, no.  Just the opposite.Upon receipt, I inspected them carefully and they looked pretty darned decent.  I was looking for any excuse to plop them back in the box and return them.  I couldn’t find anything.I appreciate that the leather upper is smooth and mildly shiny.  This is a wing tip style shoe, so I’m impressed that the extensive stitching was evenly spaced.  The leather detailing that I expect on a wing tip is also all there.Inside the shoe, it is lined from the toes all the way to the heel box… nice!  And that leather feels surprisingly supple.  That is something I would expect on a much more expensive shoe.  But definitely not at this price point.Hmm.I even liked the wax laces they chose.  They are a little thicker and have more than adequate length.  The shoe’s eyelets have interior facing metal grommets to protect against stretching and tear out of the leather and helps protect the laces against friction wear, as they are tightened and loosened over time.  Now having that detail, at this price point, has raised both of my eyebrows.Double hmm.  Now I am really impressed.The only thing that I didn’t like was that the stitching—that joins the uppers to the sole—is white.  I needed to polish these shoes anyway, so I figured I’d see what would happen if I put black polish on the stitching.I’m happy to say that the uppers shine up very nicely, to a high gloss.  This was done with just a little bit of buffing, using a traditional horse hair bristled brush.  And followed by a buffing cloth.  Although I didn’t do it, the leather is smooth enough that I  probably could have spit shined them.And those pesky white stitches on the top side of the soles?  Well I’m happy to report that they are now definitely black.Turning the shoe over, I can visually see a lump where the shank is supposed to be.  That’s a good thing. Not all shoes have a shank.  It helps to support the arch.  That’s another nice detail.  I am expecting the shank to be plastic at this price point.  So I am utterly shocked to report to you that a magnet sticks to the bottom of the shoe.  That shank is steel!  Now I am amazed!  We’re talking mind blown, Purple smoke everywhere.Speaking of details, I was very surprised to see the nicely done wing tip detailing, from on top of the shoe, carried over to the bottom of the sole.  Wow.  I have never seen that before.  That’s surprising.Now it is important to point out that the sole is some man made material.  Definitely not leather. But that’s okay.  Especially in the wet, leather wears out quickly, if you don’t wear rubber over shoes.  One less thing to fuss about.The heel itself has a band/layer of rust brown material sandwiched between black layers.  I wonder if that is a cork or bamboo material?  Having walked in these shoes, on concrete and tile floors, last week, there is a noticeable level of cush, or give. They will definitely not to be confused with sneakers.  But for dress shoes, this is a pleasant and surprising experience.The first day, I wore them at home, over the weekend and I’m glad I did that.  They needed time to adjust to my feet.  Any dress shoe that I have ever worn needs that.But after that, these shoes have been pleasant enough to walk around in at work.I’d have to say that these shoes give me at least 90% of what I would expect from my $300+ shoes for around 10% of the cost.In my estimation, at their current price point, they constitute an excellent deal.And especially if you are just breaking into the business world and need a good pair of interview shoes, these are definitely respectable… just be sure to put black polish on the white stitches.Oh, BTW, I have wider feet and I ordered the shoe wide.  After the initial stretching, they fit nicely.So, in the final analysis, what do I think?  I have to say, yes, these shoes definitely get my recommendation.  Especially if price is a huge factor, then these shoes constitute  an excellent deal.",Fantastic Shoe for the Price,2023-03-20,5.0,RAMJU9M6BAIG0,Mark G.,0.0,I really like the shoes but the size are definitely too big not a normal size.

I dig the look and I plan to use them for walking, work, and general casual use. I wanted something that I could potentially wear all day without discomfort and these seem perfect for that.The build quality is good, not excellent. It uses a faux suede material around the eyelets that looks a bit cheap. The toe box uses a formed knitted material which doesn't seem to be especially breathable (my ""light test"" showed very little light getting through) but it looks nice. There's a reflective strip with the logo on it, which I like. Compared to my expensive Altra running shoes and my Reebok cross-trainers, those shoes rely more on plasticky bits held on with glue. The overall quality of the Whitins is not far off the mark. The rubberized sole might be the first thing to wear out, as it's not especially thick. But compare that to Skechers which often go with a cheaper, less durable foam sole, and the Whitin soles look durable by comparison.If you plan to run in these, keep in mind that these are zero-drop shoes and while they have padding, it's probably not enough for people who run on their heels. It's best for fore/midfoot runners.It's really impressive that you can get something that looks nice and feels this good on your feet for such a low price.Fit: I'd go 1-1.5 sizes down from your usual.

Gather 'round and listen to me tale of the running shoes fit for a swashbuckling pirate with one leg! Aye, ye see, this one-legged buccaneer, let's call 'im Captain Hook, had a score to settle with that cheeky lad, Peter Pan. And what better way to outrun that sprite than with a trusty pair of running shoes?Now, when Captain Pegleg Pete first laid his good eye on these shoes, he thought they were the missing treasure he'd been searching for. With their sleek design and magical promises of lightning-fast speed, he knew he had to give 'em a try. But here be the funny part, me mateys!As soon as Captain Hook slipped his wooden peg into those shoes, he went from landlubber to lightning bolt! It was as if the wind itself had decided to help him out. The sheer speed of his one-legged dash would make even the mermaids jealous. But there was one tiny problem—keeping balance on a single peg with such velocity is like trying to steer a ship in a hurricane!The poor captain found himself tumbling and rolling across the deck like a drunken sailor after a particularly wild night at the tavern. One moment he'd be racing towards Neverland, the next he'd be hugging the ground, trying to catch his breath and collect his dignity. The sight of a pirate with a pegleg spinning around like a whirling dervish is enough to make even the most hardened pirate chuckle.But don't ye worry, me hearties! Captain Pegleg Pete was no quitter. He quickly realized that the shoes were meant for nimble-footed landlubbers, not sea-loving pirates like himself. So, he took a moment to adjust his technique, channeling his inner acrobat and turning those trips into a wild pirate dance.Now, if ye ever find yerself near the coast of Neverland and ye spot a one-legged pirate zooming by in a pair of running shoes, don't ye be mistaken. That be Captain Pegleg Pete, putting on a show for the ages! With every misstep and stumble, he'll have ye in stitches, laughing so hard ye might just lose track of time.So, me hearties, if ye be a landlubber in need of a laugh and some fleet-footed entertainment, get yerself a pair of these running shoes. They may not help ye outrun Peter Pan, but they'll surely give ye a show ye won't soon forget. Just be sure to bring some popcorn and a sense of humor, for Captain Pegleg Pete's piratical antics are a treasure worth witnessing!

The exterior sole is very solid, thick and hard, though the insole is soft where it should be an supporting where needed. It arrived in a tight plastic hard shrink wrap, not a shoe box, but it was adequately protected in shipping. And I adore the rainbow color.A few weird items of note, especially from the attached tag that says it is a shoe for trail running, which is not something I do:1. The solid, thick bottom is a bit heavier than runners might prefer, though this is irrelevant for my uses.2. The tag also says ""avoid dampness,"" ""do not expose to the sun for a long time,"" and ""not above 30 degrees"" (Centigrade, which is mid-80s by that American method). This can be done only if it is limited to use on an indoor track or maybe while sleeping. Of course, living in a very hot & humid climate, I'll ignore this.3. At the Amazon web pages when I ordered, there was another brand for a few cents less in price, though this other listing used the exact same descriptions and pictures as Kricely, even showing the Kricely name on the shoes pictured. I have no idea what is going on, if it is a knock-off or what.4. Compared next to my other canvas-sneaker-style shoes, the added size seems to provide a bit more width instead of length, so the larger size doesn't make it a loose fit. Works good for me.I'll admit, I could almost say 5 stars. But who'd read that?

They are both extra comfortable and are off, and back on, in seconds. They do describe them as slip-ons but you can see they are not a house slipper for those who are complaining.

I use them to go to work and they work great for me because I don't like waring high heels, they are very comfortable and they look good for a work environment. I keep buying these shoes because I have never had any problems with them in terms of being too big, or too small or making my feet hurt or bleed in some place. I just want something I know will work from the moment I put my foot in them until I have to throw them out without the anxiety of having 500 band aids handy in case they hurt me. They last me about a year/ year and half of daily use for work at an office and 2 hours of walking to and from work, so I keep buying them on repeat because they work great for my purposes. The first time I bought these shoes I bought them directly from Clarks in the store after trying them on and hoping that they would work. The other two times I bought them from amazon and they seemed identical. However, this last time I bought them these shoes via amazon, the fit is a little larger than the other two previous times, even when compared to the fit at the end of their life when they had holes in the soles. Somewhat unfortunate, but I still like them and I will keep buying them over and over, although I may drop half a size next time, I don't know.

I was looking for a nonslip shoe for work that would fit my giant feet (size 16) that also wouldn’t cost me a fortune. I was nervous about these shoes when I got them because the laces cannot be tightened there pretty much just for show but they fit pretty good and don’t feel as if they are going to fall off. At this point I’ve been wearing them for about three months and they have held up ok. The bottom of the inside of the shoes has a padding that is starting to peel off a bit and there’s a seam on the inside by my toes that sometimes pokes a bit but nothing that makes them hurt to much to wear. For a cheep pair of work shoes they will do the job.Oh and the nonslip works great have had zero issues there and the fabric of the shoe makes them very breathable.,Better then I expected.,2023-09-16,4.0,R2XAMTN7C69NPI,Ronald D Knipple,1.0,Purchased these shoes because I work 11 hour shifts in a sushi restaurant.

I bought them with the intent to go hiking around since my hiking shoes were getting worn out and I wanted to try out something lighter weight. After they arrived, I spent about a week breaking them in before going out on any hikes. Even after a week of break-in, the outsoles were still surprisingly stiff but I did like the lightness and breathability of the shoe.I take these out on a first easy hike (<1.5mi and less than 100ft elevation gain) and was not impressed at all. The grip is not good on even dry, flat rock. They seem okay on a soft path, but as soon as I encountered any wetness, the grip is poor. Wet rocks are dangerous with these shoes and I nearly fell a few times on that first easy hike just walking around.I'm not sure what Saucony means by ""Trail Running Shoe"", but I don't think they are suitable even as a ""trail walking shoe"". I wouldn't use these for anything that isn't on a paved path.I have since decided that these shoes are not to ever be used for hiking again and have relegated them to daily wear (office job) and the gym. They are okay for that purpose. After a month, the insoles and midsoles are still too stiff and do not offer much arc support. Standing around in these shoes gets my feet aching in 30 minutes or less. They are decent for the gym since they are lightweight and breathable.Overall, I would not recommend these shoes for any purpose.

They are also very slippery when walking on wet and slick floors.

They also squeak like it’s no one’s business. I haven’t tried anything to really stop the squeaking, though I expected it to stop after a few weeks of wearing them every day. They have not stopped.

While they do have some positive aspects, particularly in terms of comfort, there are certain areas where the quality and overall appearance fall short of my expectations.Starting with the positive, the barefoot style of these sneakers is something to appreciate. The minimalist design aims to mimic the feel of being barefoot, which is great for those who value natural movement and foot health. The wide fit is also a notable feature, providing ample room for toes to splay and ensuring a more comfortable experience.However, my reservations come in when evaluating the overall quality and appearance of the sneakers. The materials used, while functional, don't feel as premium as I had hoped. This affects both the durability and the overall aesthetics of the shoes. The build quality leaves a bit to be desired, and the appearance doesn't align with my personal taste.Furthermore, the design choices in terms of style and aesthetics aren't really in line with what I find visually appealing. This, of course, is subjective and may vary from person to person, but it's worth noting that the look of the sneakers didn't resonate with me.In terms of fit and comfort, these sneakers do offer a decent experience. The wide fit and the focus on mimicking a barefoot sensation contribute to a comfortable wear, especially for those who prioritize foot flexibility and natural movement.In conclusion, the WHITIN Men's Wide Minimalist Barefoot Sneakers provide a unique concept for those interested in a barefoot-style footwear experience. However, the overall quality and look weren't quite to my taste. While the comfort and fit aspects are commendable, the build quality and design didn't quite meet my expectations. It's worth considering your own preferences and priorities before making a decision on these sneakers.

Still, for the design and snug fit, the price is okay for me.  Comfort wise though, it's not soft enough for me.  I feel it's a bit stiff and I don't feel a nice bounce.  Maybe that's how proper court shoes are supposed to be, I'm not sure as I'm not really an expert on this.  I only know that I enjoy that soft cushiony feel whenever I step and test out a new shoe.

They aren't as well-known as Nike or Adidas, but they really live up to their slogan of being ""true to the sport"".I normally buy their mid-price runners. At ~25 miles per week, they last about 5 - 6 months and give good support on pavement, side roads or treadmills. I happened to spot these on sale this time and was excited to get a great deal on what looked to be a newer version of their Cohesion shoes.Long story short, these are definitely not Saucony's best shoes. They feel too light, like cheap shoes you'd find at Wal Mart. They also don't have the support I normally find with Saucony. They feel more spongey - like they won't stand up to distance-running.Only time will tell. I'm going to use them on my treadmill for now, but I definitely won't buy these again.

The Oxfords feature a sleek silhouette and high-quality leather craftsmanship that exude sophistication. Whether paired with formal attire or dressed down for a more casual look, these shoes consistently elevate my style.Beyond their aesthetics, the comfort level is exceptional. The cushioned insole provides excellent support throughout the day, making them ideal for long hours on my feet. Additionally, the outsole offers a confident grip, ensuring stability on various surfaces.I also appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction. It's evident that Clarks prioritizes durability, and I believe these shoes will stand the test of time.One minor aspect worth mentioning is the initial break-in period. Like most high-quality leather shoes, they required a few wears to conform to my feet perfectly. However, once they molded, the fit became incredibly comfortable.In conclusion, the Clarks Men's Oxford shoes offer a winning combination of style, comfort, and durability.

I got these shoes last May and wore them for almost every shift since then. Here's a review after 10 months of wearing these on concrete floors.Pros: these are non-slip. I am a clumsy person and I can tell you with confidence that I never slipped once while wearing these shoes, no matter how much water, milk or soap was on the floor.These shoes look nice, the all-over black look is very professional. If they get dirty, I just wiped them down with a cleaning wipe and they looked fine again.These shoes are water resistant, maybe even water proof. I have spilled so much hot coffee on them and my toes have remained dry and unburned.These shoes have no laces than need to be tied, so they cannot become untied and you won't trip on the laces.Cons: there is almost no support in these shoes. The sole is hard as a rock and your feet will hurt after working a full shift.Like all clothes, these loosen up over time. They are slip on shoes, so they're not really meant to be tight anyway, but there is noticeable gaping around my ankle now, my foot moves a lot in my shoe.The combination of a hard, flat sole and a loose fit is now causing me problems. My foot pain after work is now lasting several days, if I happen to have time off. I tried using an insole to add some cushion, but with such a loose shoe, the added bulk just made my foot slide off the insert, leading to a new kind of soreness after my shift.I've developed cuboid syndrome and require manual manipulation and wrapping to manage my pain. This may have been avoided if I replaced my shoes earlier, but I've always had a hard time with that. If there are no actual holes, I will keep wearing a pair of shoes.Would I buy these shoes again? Probably not these exact ones, but another pair from Sketchers, a pair with laces I can tighten as the shoe gets more worn. My advice is to skip these exact shoes, but stick with this brand. They are perfectly non-slip and water-resistant in my experience, but they require more padding, some arch support and definitely the ability to tighten them down the more you wear them.","Non-slip, water-resistant.

The fit of size L was perfect for my size 11 business shoes, which include wholecuts, Oxfords, double monk straps etc. I also own some of the higher-end brand shoe trees, and frankly do not see any difference in amount or quality of wood. The metal parts have the same thickness and springiness. Since one reviewer mentioned that they received 12 pieces for the left foot, which also were labeled 'L': yes, mine were also all labeled 'L'(arge), and there was no indication for left/right foot, but the shape clearly indicates what was right versus left. So, I received 6 pairs of size 'L', and I hope that this comment helps others in their decision to purchase this very good quality and very well priced 6-pack.Sidenote:These stretchers make a huge difference: they keep good leather dress shoes in shape (in particular those with leather soles), and the non-treated wood eliminates odors and traps moisture after wearing. Creases will form less quickly and the leather soles won't start bending upwards in the toe area.For these reasons, one should never wear the same pair of leather shoes the next day again. Trapped moisture and sweat will make the leather bulge and stretch out excessively, and the shoes will look worn out very quickly.","Good wood, identical to more pricey products",2023-08-18,5.0,R2AVL4WDQVQQVD,Amazon Customer,1.0,"I bought 6 ""pairs"" of shoe trees.

The foam feels very unresponsive and stiff but no blisters or pain so clearly a well built shoe but I'm probably not heavy enough to maximize the use of the foam. My dad who weightsmore than me really loved  them all though with his age now his runs consists more of walking than running.The size chart is also not the actual size the one on their website is more accurate but has the same issue of being based off foot length so the size us 8.5-9.5 is closer to a us 10-11 respectively for me who wears a us size 9 a 7.5-8 was closer to the actual size. I recommend  buying  based off the insole length of one of your  old shoes.Although  this shoe  is great definitely recommend  the one mix creami over this one if you're looking for a regular everyday shoe or even a daily trainer. Unfortunately they are not available on Amazon currently so you'll have to order it from their website directly if you want those.

The bad news (or maybe good news for some) is it's directly shiped form manufacturer in China so definitely not as fast Amazon and took a couple weeks to get to my door and if you made any customizations to the shoes it would probably take longerAnd if you're looking for a carbon plated shoe I definitely recommend light armor over this one while wearing these I couldn't even tell if they had carbon plates or not and had to double check the advertisement",Great shoe but the size chart is useless,2023-06-28,5.0,R2FC168I0Q38G7,Joel glassman,1.0,"I take an 8.5 W., so yes they fit but I would have preferred they come in 8.5 wide",Size and fit,2023-09-06,3.0

They'll last me years because I take good care of them. If you are a connoisseur of shoes, then you know your shoes. I know that it's rare to find a good pair of Oxfords/dress shoes online (or otherwise) for the price of these, but they have their good points.I've owned a lot of Oxfords that I wear to work. One scuff, and the cow that gave their life for your shoe is rolling around in their grave. They're super difficult to remove! And don't let it be those shoes that look wonderful online, but when you get them, they smell like gasoline for years. Why would I continue purchasing shoes that cause my automobile and office to smell like gas, that cause my tonsils to swell? I didn't just mow the lawn with these, you know. Shoes should be ready-to-wear out the box... I DENOUNCE the idea that I should 'leave my shoes outside' or put them in a bag of sodium bicarb to get rid of the horrible smell! Never again! Okay. Back to my review of these shoes. :}These shoes... well, you get what you pay for.The pros:1). Comfortable2). Not easy to scuff3). Flexible and durable; upper, inner, and bottom4). Cheap (compared to leather shoes). Damage? Easy to replace.5). No sickening my-shoes-just-went-on-a-date-with-the-gasoline-nozzle-while-the-gas-was-running smell.6). Nice, medium width7). Tasteful style8). Not easy to stain9). Super-light! You won't even notice you're wearing them.The cons:1). They are too large. I had to return my original order and reorder one size down (from 13"" to 12"")2). Poorly made; I don't believe the string at the bottom of the shoe is actually used for attachment to the shoe itself. I had to send the shoe back (again) AFTER ordering one size down because the thread was quite loose from it's intended space at the bottom. You could literally pull the string with your finger, let alone a pair of tweezers. I believe they're glued. The sewing machine (or person) used to make these shoes look like the thread is functional needs to be recalibrated.3). The hue of color between the shoe/sole/bottom isn't consistent. It seems that someone hired their child of 7 or less years of age, gave them an unscented marker, and asked them to 'Have at it' with their non-dominant hand. One of the pairs I sent back looked like someone scuffed the front of one of the shoes, slapped it back in the box, resent to another customer. With every pair I had to send back, I kept my fingers crossed that the next pair would be better. But, it's what you get when you pay for shoes like these (rolling my eyes).4). Lack of ventilation. Leather breathes, these do not. I feel like my feet need an asthma pump after a day of keeping these bad boys on.5). Slippery bottoms. You literally may benefit from standing on the road and scraping the bottom to get a little bit of 'grip' on them. This is a half-con because eventually, it gets better within the week.Overall, these shoes are decent for the price. I've not owned non-leather shoes for years, but these are worth being in my closet. I have a black pair and a brown pair, and my review is the same for both of them. I had to send the black pair back about 3 times (size, damaged product, damaged product), but at the end, I'm satisfied.

I just want something I know will work from the moment I put my foot in them until I have to throw them out without the anxiety of having 500 band aids handy in case they hurt me. They last me about a year/ year and half of daily use for work at an office and 2 hours of walking to and from work, so I keep buying them on repeat because they work great for my purposes. The first time I bought these shoes I bought them directly from Clarks in the store after trying them on and hoping that they would work. The other two times I bought them from amazon and they seemed identical. However, this last time I bought them these shoes via amazon, the fit is a little larger than the other two previous times, even when compared to the fit at the end of their life when they had holes in the soles. Somewhat unfortunate, but I still like them and I will keep buying them over and over, although I may drop half a size next time, I don't know.

I've had no problems with them, they fit great and I haven't seen any quality issues, no seams coming apart. If they made a version of these with a stiffer rock plate insert in them they'd be my perfect trail running shoe. Unfortunately the trails I run on are so rocky, that I am looking for another shoe with more protection. I am very careful how I run and where I step and I don't injure my heels as I land flat footed or on my toes. But some parts of the trails I run on there is nowhere to go to avoid golf ball sized rocks and I tend to hurt the balls of my feet as the rocks really poke through. You can definitely feel the trail and have great control, I have no worries about ankle sprains which has plagued me in the past before I went with minimal shoes. But the shoes are so flexible the impact of the rocks are starting to tear up the bottom of the insert and the minor injuries are keeping me from running as much as I'd like. If you run on more reasonable trails I highly recommend these shoes.","Has held up well, fit great, feel the trail",2023-09-26,5.0,R1RW6F154YNQ1F,Alder Stone,21.0,"I should make clear that my mediocre rating (3 stars) has nothing to do with the quality of the shoes materials and workmanship, and probably not for the design.  Based on prior reviews, many people clearly like these.  But they didn't work for me.This was my first experience with this kind of shoe.  In my 72 years, I've worn dress shoes, athletic shoes, sandals (Chacos are my top), and boots of all kind.  But never anything like this.  But I wanted something light weight for workouts with my flow ropes, so thought I'd try these out.UPS delivered mine about 11 am this morning. I wore them around my apartment for a few hours on hardwood floors, a bit of carpet, and a rubber kitchen mat.  By 3 pm, I'd decided to return them.  There are multiple reasons why, in no particular order.1) They are a PITA to put on.  Since there is no tongue, they don't open wide like shoes with a real tongue.  Worse, the loop on the back above the heel is so small that getting my index finger into it was difficult -- and I have small hands for man (I wear size small gloves).  If both ends of the loop were sewn on the outside, it would work.  But one end is outside, the other end inside, so it straddles the edge.2) I've been wearing size 9 everything for decades.  So I purchased size 9 (42) because they are reportedly true to size.  But these were at least an inch too long for me.  I guess I could have lived with it, but ...3) I laced them up very loosely -- actually time with the laces completely untied -- yet they felt very tight across the top of my foot (the ""bridge"" just forward from my ankle).  And that's even with my narrow feet (I'm a 9A.)  When sitting or lying in my hammock, I felt that my foot was going to go to sleep -- that tingling sensation.  I was wearing a lightweight sock -- lightest I had, so that contributed.  I know that most people wear these without socks, but I hate that, and these were not comfortable on my bare skin at all.  I suppose I could have ordered some thin, dress socks, but I really never wear that kind.4) This last factor is what made me decide to return them.  The top of the opening -- a lightly padded ""ridge"" -- rubs against my ankle on the outside of my foot -- the ankle ""bump"".  It was starting to chafe after only moderate movement (dance movements to simulate exercise).So, again, I'm not knocking the design -- lots of people like them -- nor the quality of materials or workmanship.  But they didn't work for me.  I'm going to order a new pair of Chacos and call it good.","Good quality shoes, but they didn't work for me",2023-02-24,3.0

My job has me on my feet 8-10 hours a day constantly walking back and forth.  I started off wearing regular low-cut walking/hiking shoes but quickly changed to the mid-boot style for better ankle support.  I've worn both the Crestwood and Redmond varieties and both worked well.  Both styles lasted me about 18 months but invariably, because of their construction combined with choice of materials, ultimately wore out at the same place... where the toe-box flexes by the ball of your foot.  The woven fabric material inevitably developed holes at this point.... no matter how well I took care of them.I recently decided to try these Newton Ridge Plus IIs and am quite surprised.  They looked a bit ""clunky"" in the photos but they fit like a dream.  I've never had a shoe/boot fit so well and they're much lighter than what they look like in photos.I wanted an all-around waterproof boot that will hold up to winter weather... doing chores... going food shopping... general work-day use and these look like they'll fill the bill... time will tell.

So this review comes soon after purchase, I might try an update after 6 months to see if perspectives change.The good, these boots are really comfortable and lightweight to wear. If you didn’t look at them you could almost think they are sneakers. So far, the waterproof capability is good straight from Columbia and I have walked several days in a row in wet grassy trails and my wool socks were bone dry.The bad, these might be specific to my situation but I wanted to put it out there. The tread pattern on the soles is spaced very wide and the material is quite soft (which makes them very comfortable to walk in); this poses a problem for the honey locust trees on our property which puncture tires and go through soles like a hot knife through butter. I’m worried the durability of these soles will not be the best. Another personal dislike is the cheap laces, I quickly put a good pair of leather laces on them and they stay secured much better.

Although this is a great way to try things and make sure you want them before you buy it like in a store, especially with shoes which I am glad I had done, since these shoes run small for their US sizes, as if you are a size 5.5 wide (advisable to get wide) in US size, then a size 7 wide would be perfect, and if you are buying for a growing kid, like me, I got the 7.5 wide and it fits nicely with room to grow.The exchange is great and loved how it was easy to do except that you can't arrange for them to pick them up when they deliver the pair that you order for exchange.  Not sure why that is, had to take an uber (since I don't have transportation) to the UPS store but it went really quick, a scan of the QR codes and dropped it off, no problems and no labels to print.  Easy peasy.

However, after wearing them for a few weeks, I'm deeply disappointed with the overall quality and durability of these shoes.The first thing that struck me was the cheap material used in the construction of these shoes. The mesh upper, while touted as breathable, feels flimsy and thin. It gives off an impression that it won't withstand regular wear and tear, let alone provide any real protection against water. Within just a few wears, I noticed signs of fraying along the edges, which raises serious doubts about the long-term durability of these shoes.Moreover, the comfort level of the Avia Anchor SR shoes is not up to par. The insoles lack proper cushioning, making them uncomfortable for extended periods of wear. This is particularly disappointing considering the product's marketing emphasizes comfort. The slip-on design is convenient, but the lack of proper arch support and cushioning severely impact the overall comfort experience.In terms of water resistance, these shoes fall short of their claims. While they might handle light splashes or spills, they are far from being genuinely water-resistant. I found myself with damp feet after encountering slightly wet surfaces, which is a major drawback for a shoe advertised as water-resistant.What adds to the frustration is that the non-slip feature, one of the key selling points, doesn't live up to expectations either. The outsole's traction is mediocre at best, and I experienced instances where I still felt uneasy walking on wet or slippery floors.Considering the price point of these shoes, I had hoped for better quality. Unfortunately, the Avia Anchor SR Mesh Slip On Black Non Slip Shoes for Women simply do not deliver on their promises. The lack of attention to material quality, combined with the subpar comfort and performance, make these shoes a regrettable purchase. I would advise potential buyers to explore other options that offer better durability, comfort, and value for their money.",Won't last,2023-08-25,2.0

NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT.  Plus, there areu many different materials (ie canvas, suede, leather and more.  Depending on the material used for the uppers on these shoes, if they get dirty, they can be put thru a wash cycle in any washing machine, and just wash, rinse, and air dry them (NOTE: I’ve never tried this on these clogs if they have uppers made of leather or suede.  Also, while they can easily been worn year around, the leather or suede models are especially nice in cold seasons.  I live where wintertime weather can include ice storms, or snow falls that quickly begin to partially melt on the ground and become icy patches on the ground or sidewalks that are treacherous to have to walk thru if one can’t get around them.  I know from age and experience what can (and did) happen to me in a slip and fall situation that left me with a broken hip, shattered femur, and shuttered knee; all of which left me unable to get around unaided, so I had to use a walker just to get from room to room in my house for a couple of YEARS.  Much of the physical damage and longtime recovery had to do with my age (over 60 yrs), making the kind of fractures i had to recover from, all the more longer term.  These shoes helped to prevent any further wintertime age related slips and falls. That’s not to say I couldn’t slip and fall again, for me, wearing these shoes has made slipping/falling, much less likely.  The soles of all models / styles of these shoes is made of a pliable, but heavy-duty type of synthetic rubber as is used on these shoes, like so many others on the market.  The heels are slightly raised, as iis the arch or instep areas. I find this design, as used on all styles and models of this shoe to be perfect for me at least, as a senior citizen.  Even tho some models of this style or design may be dressier than others, in my opinion, the only place where this shoe model wouldn’t work would be to a / in a / fancy wedding situation!  LOL.I have probably bought 15 -20 different styles of this shoe, but they always fit me in the same way (like a kid glove) the moment I first try them on. And, even tho I have especially wide feet, it’s like this shoe maker knew exactly how to create a size and width (mine is 7.5, WW), I’ve never encountered a situation where I buy another pair of this shoe in a new color / pattern / material or style, my 7.5 WW feet have never been dissatisfied.  With this merchant, a shoe size of 7.5 and a width of WW, have never produced a shoe where a 7.5 WW, is always just that: 7.5 WW.Finally, I’ve never found among any of the 15 to 20 pairs I’ve bought, that I have to “break them in” before they really become comfortable.  Nope; out of the box and onto my feet and I’m good to go.Oh!  One last thing.  In purchasing this shoe, I was looking for a model using medium dark beige as a color scheme.  What arrived to me when this latest purchase showed up, was far prettier in person than one could ever discern just from the photo shot.  I can’t discern from this shoe’s listing photo the total detail of the material used for the uppers.  I can’t tell from the photo alone the finer details of the design pattern.  This model’s uppers, as seen just from the photo, appear to be a lot plainer than they truly are.  When these shoes arrived in person I could then see the tiny silver/gold threads running thru the tartan plaid material.  These threads glisten in different ways depending on how the light source “hits” the pattern and reflects different elements from within the overall tartan plaid coloring in shades of beige.  I simply have never gone wrong with any of my purchases of this shoe’s huge array of colors, patterns, and design details.  ALL of them have met or surpassed my expectations.  I highly recommend this shoe.",Great Clogs!  I once again:  THE WINNER!,2022-08-20,5.0,R1DFL7LMEWWI9Y,Junejuly,52.0,"I still buy Traveltime clogs/mules because they fit great, are comfortable right out of the box, are fast and easy to get in and out of, and meet my realistic expectations.  I don’t expect them to stand in for athletic shoes or to be the shoes that I’d wear if I were going to be on my feet all day.  I love them for year round house slippers that I can keep on to take out the trash or bring in the mail.  I like to have a pair for outdoor work that I can kick off at the door.  In the “old days” I’d also have a variety of Traveltimes that I’d wear out of the house with different outfits.  They would wear reasonably well for years and I’d look forward to choosing a new pair when needed.  In this new era, I have come to terms with Easy Spirit and know their Traveltime shoes for what they are now.THEY ARE DISPOSABLE.  My indoor slippers start to look ratty and worn after just a few months.  If they have “leather” trim, it will be the bonded leather strips that will start to crack, peel and wear away within a couple of months.  (However, the suede trim stays intact.)  The material inside the heel will wear and expose the other layers inside the shoe within two months.  I’ve tried to reinforce new shoes with fabric bond or with Fray Check with no success.  I still purchase Traveltime (with the suede trim only) just for private wearing and I do not expect a pair to last more than a year.THE SIZING IS INCONSISTENT.  It does not matter if the shoes are made in Vietnam or China, the sizing will be inconsistent from color to color and pattern to pattern within the same style #.THE DESCRIPTION IS INCOMPLETE.  I’m not talking about color where individual perception can be a factor.  I’m talking about glitter and sparkle.  Either it’s there or it’s not.  If it’s there, it should be in the description.THE REVIEWS VARY WILDLY.  First choose your Traveltime clog/mule color and pattern.  Then read only the reviews of that exact shoe, starting with the NEWEST reviews first.  Reviews of other styles of Traveltime clogs/mules will not matter.  Older reviews will not matter.  There are 18,000 positive ratings on Amazon for Traveltime, but none may apply to the pair you are considering.Lately, I have had luck with these styles, but I don’t know their current availability:  Traveltime Natural 280, Traveltime 661 Pink, Traveltime Multi Black.  These had peeling leather:  Traveltime Black 960, Traveltime Gunmetal 335.  These had surprise sparkle:  Traveltime 303 Blue 450.  These were irregularly sized: Traveltime All-over Leather White.

I work 40 hours a week in a restaurant so I’m constantly on my feet which I guess increased the wear and tear but…in 6 months??!??… 😐 which means in 4 months the soles were already wearing down to the point where I have a hole in one shoe. I don’t walk on rough terrain and I take care of my shoes so the quality of rubber is similar to a yoga mat. I highly recommend leather soles/hard bottoms which will last years, but of course at a higher price.On the bright side I received a tremendous amount of compliments since purchasing these shoes because again, the black patent is so clean looking.I would try Bruno Marc again but the shoes would need to be free because…quality over quantity.",6 months of wear and tear,2023-06-17,2.0

I am afraid if I go with 1/2 size smaller then my heel will rub on back of shoe and toes will hit top of shoe.As for comfort just wearing them around indoors, my feet did not hurt however I have not worn them outside on asphalt yet because of it being a rainy day. Also I have Plantar Fushia so needed a walking shoe that had good arch support and so far I believe these shoes do. I bought these to specifically do walking in because I want to get back in shape and drop some extra weight. The true test is when I actually can get my walking in to see if they still provide comfort and keep my feet from hurting. The only negative is I feel the shoes are a over priced for wide width. I could see maybe $5.00 or $10.00 extra but $15.00 extra is ridiculous. I also feel real leather should have been used for trimming especially for the price of these walking shoes.

These shoes offer a great combination of style and functionality, making them a reliable choice for outdoor enthusiasts like myself. However, they do have a couple of downsides that I think are worth mentioning.First things first, the adidas Terrex AX4 shoes have an attractive design. I find their aesthetics to be quite appealing, and they look fantastic on the trails.Speaking of the trails, these shoes have accompanied me on hiking adventures in Zion and Alaska, and they have performed admirably. I have experienced no issues with slippage or loss of grip, which is a testament to their reliable outsole.However, one area where the Terrex AX4 falls short is in terms of comfort. While they are perfectly suitable for hiking purposes, I would not recommend them for everyday use. The cushioning is not as soft as I would have liked, and after prolonged wear, I found that my feet would feel fatigued. It would have been nice to have a bit more cushioning or support in the midsole to enhance comfort during extended periods of walking or standing.That being said, for their intended purpose as hiking shoes, the adidas Terrex AX4 shoes offer durability and stability. The construction feels sturdy, and I have noticed no signs of wear and tear despite subjecting them to challenging trails and varying weather conditions.In conclusion, the adidas Terrex AX4 shoes are a solid choice for hikers seeking a reliable and stylish option. They excel in terms of traction and durability, making them well-suited for outdoor adventures in diverse landscapes. However, if you're looking for everyday shoes with a softer and more cushioned feel, you might want to consider other options. Nonetheless, these shoes have served me well during my outdoor escapades, and I would recommend them to fellow hikers seeking reliable footwear.Overall Rating: 4/5 stars.","Good and Sturdy, but...",2023-07-12,4.0,R1YGNME7Y01IC1,D & S,0.0,This is the first pair of Adidas I have owned in many years.  I really like the look and how comfortable this shoe is.  I suffer from time to time with severe foot pain and these shoes do not seem to aggravate my feet at all.  I wear these shoes indoors 10 plus hours a day about 3 times a week.  I went with a hiking type tennis shoe in hopes the durability would be at a higher level.  Unfortunately in less than 2 months one of the shoes has a small dime size hole on the inside heel area of the shoe and the other shoe appears to be headed in the same direction.  I understand that this can happen over time but to happen so soon is extremely disappointing.,Durability in question,2023-07-30,3.0

I had to take the laces from a more expensive corset with longer laces to get the corset on with the zipper since there is no protective panel to save your skin, when I could then get it pretty tight to fit the way I like my corset to. The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

I have been looking for a dupe for the Gymshark Vital 1.0 shorts because they are my FAVORITE, and unfortunately Gymshark no longer makes them (the Vital 2.0s were not even close to an upgrade, they make your butt look like a baby diaper bum and I truly have been rage-pissed that Gymshark would ever change the most perfect shorts in the world for something so... blah.)The 1.0 version of these shorts are very close to the Gymshark Vital 1.0. They are a similar fit, equally thick, squat proof, and just the right length to have some coverage OR crank 'em up and show off your assets! The only difference that I can find, and the reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a five is that the inseams in the underneath side of the shorts have a larger gap between them. I have uploaded a picture for reference (the grey shorts are a M GS Vital, the green are a S AoxJox 1.0 version). This may not seem like much, but it's enough that I cannot ""hide"" those seams when I squat or bend over.

Was going to keep it in my vehicle but now I'll either have to get a specialty USB cable with a female end or take it in my house to charge. Why oh why did you do this, maybe there is a good reason, I sure can't see it.* Pressing the ""button"" has almost 0 tactile feel, especially with gloves [when you'd also be wearing a winter hat like this] So you basically just keep mashing it in the approximate location on your head until it turns on [or off, have to do this to adjust brightness too] Either that or take off your gloves, then its easy enough to feel. It is the center of the light and has to be pressed just right, limiting its use drastically if, like me, you need to turn it on/off frequently in the cold.Other than that, the hat itself is well made, the light is bright enough though you sure don't have to worry about blinding anyone with it.","Nice hat, light so-so",2022-12-18,3.0

It still works but it's already falling apart, that's no good.This a pretty nice set, not ultra warm though.The hat is a loose knit one without any inner insulation or anything, but it's an adequate hat, quite large.The neck warmer is the star of the show, it's comfortable, soft and furry on the inside and very warm, it's also big enough to fit about anyone.The loser here for me anyway is the gloves. They're kind of like those little stretchy gloves you may have had as a kid, but not at all that stretchy, which is a problem as they're a little small. I think for the average person they'd be fine but for those of us with large hands, not so great. I've spent quite awhile stretching the heck out of them trying to loosen them up and I HAVE gotten them to where they don't feel like they're cutting off circulation but they're still much too small for me.It's all of decent quality though, and I'm used to things not fitting being a borderline giant, I don't dock them a star for the gloves not fitting, rather for the gloves and hat not being nearly as nice as the neck warmer.","Hat and neck warmer are great(ish), gloves are small",2022-11-30,3.0

They show every dimple in legs (cellulite) and bulg in stomach and butt (panty lines,lace accents in underwear, lower mom pooch, hormonal tummy, overweight, belly expanding from breathing, pooch when sitting, etc.). They are only flattering to women with flat stomachs and smooth (cellulite free) skin. They are very high rise too, goes all the way to just a couple inches below my boobs (and I have a long torso). This is only a problem bc that is what is making the bulge appearance in the stomach worse. The wide tummy control band is great if it was placed to cover the actual stomach and not the upper rib cage area after moving around in the shorts (sitting to standing, walking, etc.). Good quality though. When I put them on they have to stretch from their resting form to fit my body and even though they stretch they don't become see through, so good fabric (thick and durable). Had a funny feel to me though like I'm going to snag it. Finally, I always have the problem of my thighs eating my shorts to a camel toe, while these do ride up some (the inseam/leg part) it's a lot less then any other pair of shorts I have ever tried, so pretty good at staying in place on the legs and the fact it's a longer inseam helps.",Very form fitting,2023-08-04,3.0

It’s like having a full-size drying rack that magically disappears when you don't need it. Plus, the whole 'fold upward' feature is a game-changer. Who knew laundry could be so...exciting?The mounting process was fairly straightforward too. The instructions were clear, and all the hardware came included. No surprise trips to the hardware store, which, let's be honest, we all dread.Now, on to the real question: Can it hold up my mountain of laundry? The answer is a resounding yes. This rack can take on jeans, heavy sweaters, and my endless collection of graphic tees without buckling.So, here's the skinny: the LIENAHU Clothes Drying Rack is a dream come true for anyone grappling with limited space.

I have been looking for a dupe for the Gymshark Vital 1.0 shorts because they are my FAVORITE, and unfortunately Gymshark no longer makes them (the Vital 2.0s were not even close to an upgrade, they make your butt look like a baby diaper bum and I truly have been rage-pissed that Gymshark would ever change the most perfect shorts in the world for something so... blah.)The 1.0 version of these shorts are very close to the Gymshark Vital 1.0. They are a similar fit, equally thick, squat proof, and just the right length to have some coverage OR crank 'em up and show off your assets! The only difference that I can find, and the reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a five is that the inseams in the underneath side of the shorts have a larger gap between them. I have uploaded a picture for reference (the grey shorts are a M GS Vital, the green are a S AoxJox 1.0 version). This may not seem like much, but it's enough that I cannot ""hide"" those seams when I squat or bend over.

Was going to keep it in my vehicle but now I'll either have to get a specialty USB cable with a female end or take it in my house to charge. Why oh why did you do this, maybe there is a good reason, I sure can't see it.* Pressing the ""button"" has almost 0 tactile feel, especially with gloves [when you'd also be wearing a winter hat like this] So you basically just keep mashing it in the approximate location on your head until it turns on [or off, have to do this to adjust brightness too] Either that or take off your gloves, then its easy enough to feel. It is the center of the light and has to be pressed just right, limiting its use drastically if, like me, you need to turn it on/off frequently in the cold.Other than that, the hat itself is well made, the light is bright enough though you sure don't have to worry about blinding anyone with it.","Nice hat, light so-so",2022-12-18,3.0

They're kind of like those little stretchy gloves you may have had as a kid, but not at all that stretchy, which is a problem as they're a little small.

They show every dimple in legs (cellulite) and bulg in stomach and butt (panty lines,lace accents in underwear, lower mom pooch, hormonal tummy, overweight, belly expanding from breathing, pooch when sitting, etc.). They are only flattering to women with flat stomachs and smooth (cellulite free) skin. They are very high rise too, goes all the way to just a couple inches below my boobs (and I have a long torso). This is only a problem bc that is what is making the bulge appearance in the stomach worse. The wide tummy control band is great if it was placed to cover the actual stomach and not the upper rib cage area after moving around in the shorts (sitting to standing, walking, etc.). Good quality though. When I put them on they have to stretch from their resting form to fit my body and even though they stretch they don't become see through, so good fabric (thick and durable). Had a funny feel to me though like I'm going to snag it. Finally, I always have the problem of my thighs eating my shorts to a camel toe, while these do ride up some (the inseam/leg part) it's a lot less then any other pair of shorts I have ever tried, so pretty good at staying in place on the legs and the fact it's a longer inseam helps.",Very form fitting,2023-08-04,3.0

So many gloves to keep on hand and colors to choose from.  My daughter’s hands are always cold.  She cannot regulate her body temperature.  So she always needs a pair of gloves close by to use.  Some of her really expensive gloves are just too hot.  Or too big and cumbersome.  Like her LlBean gloves, for example.  She is not going out into the snow.  In fact, we live in a beach town in sunny southern CA.  These are also great for the Covid that is going around so that you don’t have to touch anything.  I just totally freak out about touching germs!!  If you’re using them for Covid protection make sure to put them in your laundry basket to wash and sanitize them immediately when you take them off.  I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for wearing outside in public for Covid protection but they are not always available and this beats nothing.  These are a good back up if you don’t have disposable nitrile gloves.  They are kind of light to medium weight.  They are ok to good quality but not great quality.  I would say they are “sufficient.”  They are not designer type gloves that you would worry about wearing.  They are just inexpensive, functional gloves to protect your hands.  I would say that they probably protect and cover your hands more than they actually warm your hands.  They’re pretty light weight. I would call these “functional.” Nothing to really write home about but good to keep on hand when you want something disposable or just for hand protection.  The colors are nice.  They are vibrant and true to the online images.  Everyone should have a set of these on hand.  I do recommend these and I would purchase again.  I would order two sets if you’re also using for Covid.  And at the price you can’t go wrong. Also, They do not stretch out or change shape.

That's when these storage bags swooped in to save the day. And let me tell you, they were a game-changer.Our small personal items suddenly had a ton more room, all thanks to these compression storage bags. Now, about that electric pump – it might be small, but don't let its size fool you. It's a real powerhouse. Being USB-powered is an absolute blessing – no need to hunt for extra batteries or outlets.Quick tip – squeeze the air out of the bags manually before you connect the vacuum pump. It's a pro move that speeds things up and gets you packing in no time.Speaking of the bags, they're not just any flimsy things. Nope, these are some seriously thick bags. They mean business, and you can tell they're built to last.I'm so sold on these bags that I'm already planning to grab more for when we travel with the kids. You know how much stuff they can bring – it's a whole different ballgame.In a world where luggage fees and space are a constant battle, the 6 Pack Travel Vacuum Storage Bags with USB Electric Pump are the champions of smart packing.

Also they’re super soft, comfortable, and thick. The waist band is great quality too it doesn’t roll down and has good tummy control. The color is very good the only thing about the color is the white pair is actually a light cream color which I don’t mind, it’s still a very beautiful color. They’re very flattering and do hug your curves perfectly but not so much it’s distasteful. I got these for everyday wear because my style is comfy and layered with lots of appropriate accessories.

The wider band at the bottom makes me hopeful that they won’t roll up too much when wearing- but i will update if that changes. My only complaints so far are the white is rather sheer and would need pasties to be worn “appropriately” - and the colors in the photos show the gray to be more of a sage green which I was expecting (but that’s also my fault for not reading the entire description).Disclaimer- while I do have a broad chest my usual bra size is a 40C so it may/may not work the as well for members of the BTC.",Pleasantly surprised!,2023-09-17,4.0,R3BPLGLPS9YZ6M,Larissa Lyn,0.0,"I purchased a set of these in Feb and loved the support they gave.

When these came in I really loved the colors but the material isn’t as strong and feels a lot softer to the point that they do not provide the same support as the first purchase in Feb. they’re still good for around the house but disappointed that the quality of the fabric has changed since my original purchase(size med)I repurchased in a size small to see if that made any difference and it did, but still a far cry from the original set. The tanks don’t hold up the girls the same because the material is too loose/stretchy. A real bummer because I absolutely loved these tops for everyday wear.",Material has changed,2023-09-11,3.0

Seriously, if Transformers did laundry, this would be their go-to gear. It's so satisfying to fold it out when I need it and then tuck it away once I'm done. My tiny apartment is breathing a sigh of relief!The rack is advertised as retractable and collapsible, and let me tell you, it lives up to those claims. It’s like having a full-size drying rack that magically disappears when you don't need it. Plus, the whole 'fold upward' feature is a game-changer. Who knew laundry could be so...exciting?The mounting process was fairly straightforward too. The instructions were clear, and all the hardware came included. No surprise trips to the hardware store, which, let's be honest, we all dread.Now, on to the real question: Can it hold up my mountain of laundry? The answer is a resounding yes. This rack can take on jeans, heavy sweaters, and my endless collection of graphic tees without buckling.So, here's the skinny: the LIENAHU Clothes Drying Rack is a dream come true for anyone grappling with limited space.

The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

I have been looking for a dupe for the Gymshark Vital 1.0 shorts because they are my FAVORITE, and unfortunately Gymshark no longer makes them (the Vital 2.0s were not even close to an upgrade, they make your butt look like a baby diaper bum and I truly have been rage-pissed that Gymshark would ever change the most perfect shorts in the world for something so... blah.)The 1.0 version of these shorts are very close to the Gymshark Vital 1.0. They are a similar fit, equally thick, squat proof, and just the right length to have some coverage OR crank 'em up and show off your assets! The only difference that I can find, and the reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a five is that the inseams in the underneath side of the shorts have a larger gap between them. I have uploaded a picture for reference (the grey shorts are a M GS Vital, the green are a S AoxJox 1.0 version).

The color is true to what’s advertised and it’s really cute but the material is way too thin on the bottom.

Can't see why they didn't make it so it would charge with a cable like 99% of everything else. Was going to keep it in my vehicle but now I'll either have to get a specialty USB cable with a female end or take it in my house to charge. Why oh why did you do this, maybe there is a good reason, I sure can't see it.* Pressing the ""button"" has almost 0 tactile feel, especially with gloves [when you'd also be wearing a winter hat like this] So you basically just keep mashing it in the approximate location on your head until it turns on [or off, have to do this to adjust brightness too] Either that or take off your gloves, then its easy enough to feel. It is the center of the light and has to be pressed just right, limiting its use drastically if, like me, you need to turn it on/off frequently in the cold.Other than that, the hat itself is well made, the light is bright enough though you sure don't have to worry about blinding anyone with it.","Nice hat, light so-so",2022-12-18,3.0

They're kind of like those little stretchy gloves you may have had as a kid, but not at all that stretchy, which is a problem as they're a little small. I think for the average person they'd be fine but for those of us with large hands, not so great.

I love how it’s like the perfect length for me and it’s soft and breathable enough. It’s not a workout top. I’ll be clear on that. It’s definitely more of a day-to-day top!

There is a second ""pocket layer"" of fabric underneath where the padding cups sit.

The outer fabric also tend to rise up with any real active movement, even ""light impact"" exercises. As a dancer I wouldn't trust these to not cause a boob to fall out.

They show every dimple in legs (cellulite) and bulg in stomach and butt (panty lines,lace accents in underwear, lower mom pooch, hormonal tummy, overweight, belly expanding from breathing, pooch when sitting, etc.). They are only flattering to women with flat stomachs and smooth (cellulite free) skin. They are very high rise too, goes all the way to just a couple inches below my boobs (and I have a long torso). This is only a problem bc that is what is making the bulge appearance in the stomach worse. The wide tummy control band is great if it was placed to cover the actual stomach and not the upper rib cage area after moving around in the shorts (sitting to standing, walking, etc.). Good quality though. When I put them on they have to stretch from their resting form to fit my body and even though they stretch they don't become see through, so good fabric (thick and durable). Had a funny feel to me though like I'm going to snag it. Finally, I always have the problem of my thighs eating my shorts to a camel toe, while these do ride up some (the inseam/leg part) it's a lot less then any other pair of shorts I have ever tried, so pretty good at staying in place on the legs and the fact it's a longer inseam helps.",Very form fitting,2023-08-04,3.0

So many gloves to keep on hand and colors to choose from.  My daughter’s hands are always cold.  She cannot regulate her body temperature.  So she always needs a pair of gloves close by to use.  Some of her really expensive gloves are just too hot.  Or too big and cumbersome.  Like her LlBean gloves, for example.  She is not going out into the snow.  In fact, we live in a beach town in sunny southern CA.  These are also great for the Covid that is going around so that you don’t have to touch anything.  I just totally freak out about touching germs!!  If you’re using them for Covid protection make sure to put them in your laundry basket to wash and sanitize them immediately when you take them off.  I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for wearing outside in public for Covid protection but they are not always available and this beats nothing.  These are a good back up if you don’t have disposable nitrile gloves.  They are kind of light to medium weight.  They are ok to good quality but not great quality.  I would say they are “sufficient.”  They are not designer type gloves that you would worry about wearing.  They are just inexpensive, functional gloves to protect your hands.  I would say that they probably protect and cover your hands more than they actually warm your hands.  They’re pretty light weight. I would call these “functional.” Nothing to really write home about but good to keep on hand when you want something disposable or just for hand protection.  The colors are nice.  They are vibrant and true to the online images.  Everyone should have a set of these on hand.  I do recommend these and I would purchase again.  I would order two sets if you’re also using for Covid.  And at the price you can’t go wrong. Also, They do not stretch out or change shape.

That's when these storage bags swooped in to save the day. And let me tell you, they were a game-changer.Our small personal items suddenly had a ton more room, all thanks to these compression storage bags. Now, about that electric pump – it might be small, but don't let its size fool you. It's a real powerhouse. Being USB-powered is an absolute blessing – no need to hunt for extra batteries or outlets.Quick tip – squeeze the air out of the bags manually before you connect the vacuum pump. It's a pro move that speeds things up and gets you packing in no time.Speaking of the bags, they're not just any flimsy things. Nope, these are some seriously thick bags. They mean business, and you can tell they're built to last.I'm so sold on these bags that I'm already planning to grab more for when we travel with the kids. You know how much stuff they can bring – it's a whole different ballgame.In a world where luggage fees and space are a constant battle, the 6 Pack Travel Vacuum Storage Bags with USB Electric Pump are the champions of smart packing.

My  biggest problem with them is that the elastic in the waistband is too tight.  I measured my wrists and they are 6 inches, which I think is about average, but the elastic leaves marks on my wrists.  If they had made them only 1/2 inch bigger, I think they would have been much more comfortable.

These are designed to blend and appear more natural because they fill  that area under your arm. If you have to use breast forms you'll know just what I'm talking about.  Great for mastectomy bras or filling in with a regular bra. A big plus is they stay in place and give to that firm lifted look they are lite weight too..

The edge of one of the triangles wasn’t sewn down underneath the “tulle” and it made it look a bit off. For anyone wondering regarding cleavage, I’m a 36B. Ordered a size L. Straps in back are adjustable.I’m 5’11 and the “tulle” hit my ankles but the liner hit just above the ankles. I was hoping for something to go to my feet. Liner is nice though, no issue with it being see through. However - the liner has two slits in the front that go up very high, and depending on movement, you could see the bottom of my underwear a bit through the “tulle” material.Also I keep saying tulle but that’s not what it actually is, it’s a soft material.",Cute but flawed,2023-01-12,3.0

I am normally a 3x but when I got it the first time I couldn’t even get it on. So I reordered it in a 5x. It fit great  I felt great but then the events of this weekend happened. I decided to wear this top to a concert. Sounds good yeah. There’s three acts. The top made it through the first two acts. Then about ten minutes in to the third band, pop! The zipper broke open! There I was middle of a metal concert holding my top closed. Thank god I had a jacket because I opted to go brakes with the top. I tried to fix the top after the show but it was beyond repair. Maybe I should’ve ordered another size up. Maybe the zipper should have been stronger. All I know is the moment I started to actually move and not stand still like a tree I was out in the wind. So if you are going to buy it know a couple things. One the chain is really flimsy and hangs a little too low and broke very soon after I bought the top. Two if you are gonna buy it you may have to order 2-3 sizes larger (this may just be for the more cursed few of the large chest Community). Three the little cloth piece in the back is only a few inches long so if you have a wider set abdomen you’re gonna be tucking it off to the side. I really liked the top and I wished it had lasted but it didn’t.",This top probably has given me one of the funniest stories of my life,2023-09-26,2.0

I did take my measurements into account with the picture when ordering and it still was technically too small. I had to take the laces from a more expensive corset with longer laces to get the corset on with the zipper since there is no protective panel to save your skin, when I could then get it pretty tight to fit the way I like my corset to. The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

It fits me perfectly and I didn't need to adjust too much. As for the top accent at the shoulders and neck, it's a size too large. I'd have to add new holes in place to strap it tighter, but then the back of the fabric is too lose and there's a big gap between the fabric and my back.However, if I go down a size, the bodice would be way too small for me to fit into.

Can't see why they didn't make it so it would charge with a cable like 99% of everything else. Was going to keep it in my vehicle but now I'll either have to get a specialty USB cable with a female end or take it in my house to charge. Why oh why did you do this, maybe there is a good reason, I sure can't see it.* Pressing the ""button"" has almost 0 tactile feel, especially with gloves [when you'd also be wearing a winter hat like this] So you basically just keep mashing it in the approximate location on your head until it turns on [or off, have to do this to adjust brightness too] Either that or take off your gloves, then its easy enough to feel. It is the center of the light and has to be pressed just right, limiting its use drastically if, like me, you need to turn it on/off frequently in the cold.Other than that, the hat itself is well made, the light is bright enough though you sure don't have to worry about blinding anyone with it.","Nice hat, light so-so",2022-12-18,3.0

Although I was pleasantly surprised that a medium fit me (I'm 5'8"" and wear a US size 8-10 in bottoms and a 36DD in bra sizing), the shorts on these were WAY too long. They went down to my mid-low thigh and I would've had to roll the waist down 3-4 times to even be a normal length for women's pajama shorts.

Regarding the fit, I was definitely expecting it to be longer considering how wide it is. The construction isn't bad, however the pocket flaps are not attached to anything and there is no inner lining - so when hanging open it is unattractive. I'll be going in and adding a few stitches to keep the pockets in place so they don't hang below the hem of the jacket.The quality looks okay, but I haven't washed or dried yet. I would expect that to much washing and drying will cause pilling. Also, buttons aren't attached very well. I expect to have to reattach those at some point.Overall, it isn't horrible.

The wider band at the bottom makes me hopeful that they won’t roll up too much when wearing- but i will update if that changes.

It's white, sleek, and doesn't clash with my decor. But it's the functionality that really makes this baby shine.This isn't just another drying rack; it's a wall-mountable, folding marvel. Seriously, if Transformers did laundry, this would be their go-to gear. It's so satisfying to fold it out when I need it and then tuck it away once I'm done. My tiny apartment is breathing a sigh of relief!The rack is advertised as retractable and collapsible, and let me tell you, it lives up to those claims. It’s like having a full-size drying rack that magically disappears when you don't need it. Plus, the whole 'fold upward' feature is a game-changer. Who knew laundry could be so...exciting?The mounting process was fairly straightforward too. The instructions were clear, and all the hardware came included. No surprise trips to the hardware store, which, let's be honest, we all dread.Now, on to the real question: Can it hold up my mountain of laundry? The answer is a resounding yes. This rack can take on jeans, heavy sweaters, and my endless collection of graphic tees without buckling.So, here's the skinny: the LIENAHU Clothes Drying Rack is a dream come true for anyone grappling with limited space. It's sleek, efficient, and sturdy. It doesn't matter if you're dealing with a mountain of clothes or just a handful of delicates, this rack has got you covered.In short, this folding wonder has totally transformed my laundry routine.

The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

I have been looking for a dupe for the Gymshark Vital 1.0 shorts because they are my FAVORITE, and unfortunately Gymshark no longer makes them (the Vital 2.0s were not even close to an upgrade, they make your butt look like a baby diaper bum and I truly have been rage-pissed that Gymshark would ever change the most perfect shorts in the world for something so... blah.)The 1.0 version of these shorts are very close to the Gymshark Vital 1.0. They are a similar fit, equally thick, squat proof, and just the right length to have some coverage OR crank 'em up and show off your assets! The only difference that I can find, and the reason I gave them a 4 star instead of a five is that the inseams in the underneath side of the shorts have a larger gap between them. I have uploaded a picture for reference (the grey shorts are a M GS Vital, the green are a S AoxJox 1.0 version). This may not seem like much, but it's enough that I cannot ""hide"" those seams when I squat or bend over.

Why oh why did you do this, maybe there is a good reason, I sure can't see it.* Pressing the ""button"" has almost 0 tactile feel, especially with gloves [when you'd also be wearing a winter hat like this] So you basically just keep mashing it in the approximate location on your head until it turns on [or off, have to do this to adjust brightness too] Either that or take off your gloves, then its easy enough to feel. It is the center of the light and has to be pressed just right, limiting its use drastically if, like me, you need to turn it on/off frequently in the cold.Other than that, the hat itself is well made, the light is bright enough though you sure don't have to worry about blinding anyone with it.","Nice hat, light so-so",2022-12-18,3.0

They're kind of like those little stretchy gloves you may have had as a kid, but not at all that stretchy, which is a problem as they're a little small.

They show every dimple in legs (cellulite) and bulg in stomach and butt (panty lines,lace accents in underwear, lower mom pooch, hormonal tummy, overweight, belly expanding from breathing, pooch when sitting, etc.). They are only flattering to women with flat stomachs and smooth (cellulite free) skin. They are very high rise too, goes all the way to just a couple inches below my boobs (and I have a long torso). This is only a problem bc that is what is making the bulge appearance in the stomach worse. The wide tummy control band is great if it was placed to cover the actual stomach and not the upper rib cage area after moving around in the shorts (sitting to standing, walking, etc.). Good quality though. When I put them on they have to stretch from their resting form to fit my body and even though they stretch they don't become see through, so good fabric (thick and durable). Had a funny feel to me though like I'm going to snag it. Finally, I always have the problem of my thighs eating my shorts to a camel toe, while these do ride up some (the inseam/leg part) it's a lot less then any other pair of shorts I have ever tried, so pretty good at staying in place on the legs and the fact it's a longer inseam helps.",Very form fitting,2023-08-04,3.0

So many gloves to keep on hand and colors to choose from.  My daughter’s hands are always cold.  She cannot regulate her body temperature.  So she always needs a pair of gloves close by to use.  Some of her really expensive gloves are just too hot.  Or too big and cumbersome.  Like her LlBean gloves, for example.  She is not going out into the snow.  In fact, we live in a beach town in sunny southern CA.  These are also great for the Covid that is going around so that you don’t have to touch anything.  I just totally freak out about touching germs!!  If you’re using them for Covid protection make sure to put them in your laundry basket to wash and sanitize them immediately when you take them off.  I prefer to use disposable nitrile gloves for wearing outside in public for Covid protection but they are not always available and this beats nothing.  These are a good back up if you don’t have disposable nitrile gloves.  They are kind of light to medium weight.  They are ok to good quality but not great quality.  I would say they are “sufficient.”  They are not designer type gloves that you would worry about wearing.  They are just inexpensive, functional gloves to protect your hands.  I would say that they probably protect and cover your hands more than they actually warm your hands.  They’re pretty light weight. I would call these “functional.” Nothing to really write home about but good to keep on hand when you want something disposable or just for hand protection.  The colors are nice.  They are vibrant and true to the online images.  Everyone should have a set of these on hand.  I do recommend these and I would purchase again.  I would order two sets if you’re also using for Covid.  And at the price you can’t go wrong. Also, They do not stretch out or change shape.

That's when these storage bags swooped in to save the day. And let me tell you, they were a game-changer.Our small personal items suddenly had a ton more room, all thanks to these compression storage bags. Now, about that electric pump – it might be small, but don't let its size fool you. It's a real powerhouse. Being USB-powered is an absolute blessing – no need to hunt for extra batteries or outlets.Quick tip – squeeze the air out of the bags manually before you connect the vacuum pump. It's a pro move that speeds things up and gets you packing in no time.Speaking of the bags, they're not just any flimsy things. Nope, these are some seriously thick bags. They mean business, and you can tell they're built to last.I'm so sold on these bags that I'm already planning to grab more for when we travel with the kids. You know how much stuff they can bring – it's a whole different ballgame.In a world where luggage fees and space are a constant battle, the 6 Pack Travel Vacuum Storage Bags with USB Electric Pump are the champions of smart packing.

Also they’re super soft, comfortable, and thick. The waist band is great quality too it doesn’t roll down and has good tummy control. The color is very good the only thing about the color is the white pair is actually a light cream color which I don’t mind, it’s still a very beautiful color. They’re very flattering and do hug your curves perfectly but not so much it’s distasteful. I got these for everyday wear because my style is comfy and layered with lots of appropriate accessories.

I am normally a 3x but when I got it the first time I couldn’t even get it on. So I reordered it in a 5x. It fit great  I felt great but then the events of this weekend happened. I decided to wear this top to a concert. Sounds good yeah. There’s three acts. The top made it through the first two acts. Then about ten minutes in to the third band, pop! The zipper broke open! There I was middle of a metal concert holding my top closed. Thank god I had a jacket because I opted to go brakes with the top. I tried to fix the top after the show but it was beyond repair. Maybe I should’ve ordered another size up. Maybe the zipper should have been stronger. All I know is the moment I started to actually move and not stand still like a tree I was out in the wind. So if you are going to buy it know a couple things. One the chain is really flimsy and hangs a little too low and broke very soon after I bought the top. Two if you are gonna buy it you may have to order 2-3 sizes larger (this may just be for the more cursed few of the large chest Community). Three the little cloth piece in the back is only a few inches long so if you have a wider set abdomen you’re gonna be tucking it off to the side. I really liked the top and I wished it had lasted but it didn’t.",This top probably has given me one of the funniest stories of my life,2023-09-26,2.0

I did take my measurements into account with the picture when ordering and it still was technically too small. I had to take the laces from a more expensive corset with longer laces to get the corset on with the zipper since there is no protective panel to save your skin, when I could then get it pretty tight to fit the way I like my corset to. The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

It fits me perfectly and I didn't need to adjust too much. As for the top accent at the shoulders and neck, it's a size too large. I'd have to add new holes in place to strap it tighter, but then the back of the fabric is too lose and there's a big gap between the fabric and my back.However, if I go down a size, the bodice would be way too small for me to fit into.

Can't see why they didn't make it so it would charge with a cable like 99% of everything else. Was going to keep it in my vehicle but now I'll either have to get a specialty USB cable with a female end or take it in my house to charge. Why oh why did you do this, maybe there is a good reason, I sure can't see it.* Pressing the ""button"" has almost 0 tactile feel, especially with gloves [when you'd also be wearing a winter hat like this] So you basically just keep mashing it in the approximate location on your head until it turns on [or off, have to do this to adjust brightness too] Either that or take off your gloves, then its easy enough to feel. It is the center of the light and has to be pressed just right, limiting its use drastically if, like me, you need to turn it on/off frequently in the cold.Other than that, the hat itself is well made, the light is bright enough though you sure don't have to worry about blinding anyone with it.","Nice hat, light so-so",2022-12-18,3.0

Although I was pleasantly surprised that a medium fit me (I'm 5'8"" and wear a US size 8-10 in bottoms and a 36DD in bra sizing), the shorts on these were WAY too long. They went down to my mid-low thigh and I would've had to roll the waist down 3-4 times to even be a normal length for women's pajama shorts.

It was very flattering and was super comfy. I thought that the fabric was great (especially for the price!) with how thick it is and how much stretch is given. I didn’t wear a bra also, and it was really nice and supportive for my chest. I think the only downfall would be around my thighs. I have thicker thighs and the shorts rose up a bit, but i usually anticipate shorts riding up so not much of a problem for me.Would really suggest everyone to buy it!",So comfy,2023-08-27,5.0,R3J0JBO8ZH0JH7,Brandon Reid,0.0,I’m usually run a size small and so I ordered a size small.

Pico remotes can be easily programmed to control individual or multiple lights/plugs at the same time.  Multiple remotes also can control the same lights/plugs such as having a set  of remotes for each side of the bed.  For the two bedside reading lights I ordered  Pico remotes with an illuminated center buttons.The dimmer also works perfectly with my Philips GU-10 LED bulbs in the ceiling's recessed fixtures -- these bulbs get warmer as you dim them.  I also recommend buying the weighted bases to hold the remotes -- in my configuration, I have three remotes on each bedside, which fit neatly together in these angled bases - they come in single, double and triple models.  These stands also protects the remotes from getting wet if you knock over a glass of water during the night, and keeps our cat from batting them off the nightstand.My only issue was that I accidentally programmed one of the remotes to turn on and off more than one lamp, and Lutron's customer forum is a bit kludgy to navigate.  Some of the suggestions didn't work for my Caseta / Pico remote combo, but another customer reported that he spoke with a live Lutron agent and these steps worked:1) On the lower off button on the Pico remote, quickly tap 4 times and hold down the button on the 5th press until the solid green light comes on.  Then again quickly tap the lower button 4 times.2) The above worked perfectly to reset the Pico remote, and I was easily able to reprogram it by holding down the off button on the wall switch until it flashes, and then holding down the off button on the Pico remote until it flashes and synchs with the switch.",Saves Electrical Wiring Costs and Labor,2023-09-07,5.0,R35JZNKKL6KGKK,Sandra Marlow,0.0,This model did not work for us.

The top part is also wonky with sizing and may not fit properly without tailoring.Also, with wearing for two days my ribs are sore from wear with how thin the boning is, it’s odd how I could flip the bottom half of my corset up to use the restroom as that’s impossible with more well made ones.Overall, the price is decent and I love the design of it so it’s a keeper for me personally.

Also the lid doesn’t lock so you don’t have to use wipes that are accordion folded (we use water wipes because they’re the gentlest and they’re not continuous-feed).Overall we’re very happy with this warmer, the only downside is that it’s not hard to accidentally touch the buttons to turn it off, but just pay attention to what you’re doing and it won’t be a problem.",This warmer actually works,2023-08-21,5.0,R3NHP82ZCUKGEC,T,3.0,"...but its not easy getting the wipes out. I guess the wipe brand matters - the Water Wipes are by far the WORST to use in this. They're so hard to pull out individually in general, when theyre in this I have to grab a clump of them and it becomes wasteful. The huggies wipes do much better since they come out easier. When the wipes are low its a lot harder to pull them out. The unit also does not protect the wipes from drying out, so you have to be aware of closing the wipes inside AND closing the unit. When the wipe leaves the unit it becomes cold within in a few seconds, so you really have to be quick. It would be better utilized if we lived in a colder climate. As it is it seems to waste your time when you're fumbling around changing a diaper in low light.I primarily use this for the little light it gives off. It's actually super helpful to have the light AND the wipes in the same area. I've successfully done a few dream feeds and changed diapers without waking the baby thanks to this because I didnt have to turn on the main room lights, keeping the area dark. Makes me feel like a ninja to be able to do it all without waking baby!",Does what its supposed to do,2022-10-10,3.0

When you get to your destination, you just hang the organizer up up and pull your clothes out as needed.  Genius.  This would work particularly well on a trip that includes several different hotels/destinations. The problem is this particular version is made with cheap materials, so I have concerns about longevity.  I would look for something similar that is better quality.

I'm slender and athletic (5'9"", 137 lbs) but I can't stand if something is tight on my waist.  It makes me feel nauseous.  Usually if I size up, I'm pulling my leggings up all day.  These shorts are not like that at all!  I did order a large for a more comfortable waist and I'm glad I did.  They are very flattering!  This is also my first pair of seamless and I'm never going back!  No camel toe!  I just ordered the full leggings and I'm hoping I feel just as satisfied with those!",Size up for a more comfortable waist.,2023-09-18,5.0,R2VOP5XJNP6KIY,Amazon Customer,187.0,"This review might be a little long but HEAR ME OUT!  When I tell you I sprinted to go on amazon and try these babies out, guuuuurrrrrllll I mf SPRINTED! I had to see if these were the ultimate dupes for one of my favorite gym shorts or even better. I had super high hopes for these beauties and even though they are not what I was expecting they are damn near close. So I thought I would share my thoughts because I can't stop thinking about these shorts and I WANT to be a huge fan of them! If there's an update on these shorts in the future, you best believe I'm buying ALL the colors in my size!!!So let's start with the positives. These shorts are admittedly on another level in a good way! They are comfy, soft, breathable, stretchy, squat proof (at least the color I tried on), and fits in almost all the right places for me. To give you a mental picture I would say that I have a curvy athletic build, super tall 6'1"", around 180 pounds, and hold most of my weight in the lower region of my body aka below the hips. My peach is a combination of fat and muscle but it is not like the super perky butts you see on social media. So I tend to spend some coin on shorts and leggings that flatter that part of my body for added confidence. Then I heard about these bad boys and gave them a shot. I got a size L (I'm usually between M-L) because I personally like the extra room for the gainz and I usually like sizing up in short anyways but I digress.Even though I've only tried them on, I would say they are sooooooo close to being the perfect dupe of ""that brand"" that has blown up for their amplify collection. I think these are great for a lift, yoga, walks, hikes, lounging around and probably even other forms of cardio. From my short test I did at home while trying these on (squats, high knees kicks, and jumps) I feel pretty confident that the scrunch won't break easily.  When it comes to the fit, they are not a long biker short on me but they don't show any cake spilling out in the back after some movement and I'm a tall gal with a dumpy and lots of shorts usually show a little somethin somethin after I move around. Another plus is they don't create muffin quads on my big thighs and it's very common for shorts to make my legs look chunky.HOWEVER, where I think these shorts lack is the booty region which I find to be pretty important since these shorts have a scrunch in the back for the ""peach"" effect. I will say I like that the scrunch isn't too much like most scrunch butts where it screams ""look at me"" and it doesn't give me a unibutt either. But sadly this scrunch for some reason doesn't flatter my booty at all. I even asked my boyfriend for his opinion and I showed him these shorts and the shorts they are a dupes for one after the other multiple times and he agrees that these shorts don't do it for me but the amplify shorts do. I did notice when I put the shorts side by side the scrunch on the Aurola shorts doesn't go all the way to the gusset crotch seam and I thought that might be the problem but I'm not entirely sure. I mean if these shorts could make my cheeks look amazing then they would be my favorite gym shorts EVAHHHHH! Another con for me is the logo. I do feel a little self-conscious with the words being close to another word ""areo...""... I mean if you know, you know. I hope these changes can be made because I would get them again in a heart beat and probably try the leggings too.","ALMOST the perfect shorts! (Tried on size L, Seal Brown)",2022-01-13,3.0

I am normally a 3x but when I got it the first time I couldn’t even get it on. So I reordered it in a 5x. It fit great  I felt great but then the events of this weekend happened. I decided to wear this top to a concert. Sounds good yeah. There’s three acts. The top made it through the first two acts. Then about ten minutes in to the third band, pop! The zipper broke open! There I was middle of a metal concert holding my top closed. Thank god I had a jacket because I opted to go brakes with the top. I tried to fix the top after the show but it was beyond repair. Maybe I should’ve ordered another size up. Maybe the zipper should have been stronger. All I know is the moment I started to actually move and not stand still like a tree I was out in the wind. So if you are going to buy it know a couple things. One the chain is really flimsy and hangs a little too low and broke very soon after I bought the top. Two if you are gonna buy it you may have to order 2-3 sizes larger (this may just be for the more cursed few of the large chest Community). Three the little cloth piece in the back is only a few inches long so if you have a wider set abdomen you’re gonna be tucking it off to the side. I really liked the top and I wished it had lasted but it didn’t.",This top probably has given me one of the funniest stories of my life,2023-09-26,2.0

It probably would be too tight on someone with a large cranium.I like the stretchy fabric beside the ears. Its thinner than the rest of the gear and this helps for hearing in the woods. The facemask part is too loose on the front of my face. There us an adjustment in the back but even at its tightest it's still too loose. So my glasses tend to fog up because it's not tight enough on my nose. Most of the time I wear it down on my chin anyway. If I were to make any changes I would put a moldable metal strip in the nose to help it get tighter across the nose.

This sleeveless romper has quickly become a favorite for several reasons.Firstly, the comfort level is outstanding. The loose, baggy fit provides a relaxed feel that's perfect for hot summer days. The spaghetti straps are delicate and comfortable on the shoulders, allowing for a cool and breezy wear.The inclusion of pockets is a delightful surprise. They are not only functional but add a touch of practicality to this fashionable piece. It's convenient to have a place for my essentials while still maintaining a sleek and stylish look.The fabric is light and breathable, making it ideal for the summer season. It doesn't cling to the body and allows for easy movement. I appreciate how easy it is to slip in and out of this jumpsuit, thanks to the convenient zipper closure at the back.This jumpsuit is incredibly versatile. It's suitable for both casual outings and more dressed-up occasions, depending on how it's accessorized. I've received numerous compliments when wearing it, which is always a plus!In summary, the AUTOMET Jumpsuit for Women is a fantastic addition to any summer wardrobe. Its comfort, style, practicality, and versatility make it a top choice.

It will shrink, and not in a good way. The legs easily shrunk by two inches and the back (above the butt area) now bubbles out so, while it wasn't highly flattering to begin with, the back bubble creates an extreme flat and saggy butt look - like your 90 years old and have no butt whatsoever.  I have the FP one and it is definitely a higher quality. The fabric on the FP one is softer and the seams/sewing is just better. The FP one does not shrink in the dryer and lays differently in the butt area so that you can at least tell there is some form of a butt there. I bought two of these dupes because for the price point, I can have two for the price of one and I'm sure these will go out of style in the next couple years or so and I don't really care how unflattering they are because they are wicked comfy.  BUT, my recommendation is if you're just going to buy one, go with the original FP, it's much higher quality- from the fabric to the fit as well as being softer, not to mention it (the FP one) holds up in the wash because after one wash, this dupe is already starting to pil.","Not as good as FP but for the price, it's fine.",2023-08-29,3.0
